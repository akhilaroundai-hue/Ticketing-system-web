To keep a record of all your business transactions, you need to first create a company in TallyPrime. Through the company, you can also view and update all your transaction entries, as needed, and go through the financial reports based on the transactions that you maintain.\n\nOnce you create your company, you can set up the following:\n\n- [Company Features](https://help.tallysolutions.com/company-features-f11-tally/)\n- [Load Company, Data Path, Auto-Login, Language, Multiple Addresses](https://help.tallysolutions.com/set-up-tallyprime-auto-login-language-multiple-addresses/#set-up-tallyprime-load-company-data-path-auto-login-language-multiple-addresses)\n\nClick to know more...\n\n**Create company**: To create the company, just enter the company name, address and other details, such as financial year, security, and base currency information. Once you have created your company, based on your business preferences, you can use the [**Company Features**](https://help.tallysolutions.com/company-features-f11-tally/) such as accounting, inventory, payroll, and taxation features. You can also specify the tax registration details as applicable, such as GST, VAT, Excise, TCS, or TDS, which can be accounted for your transactions.\n\n**Security**: All the business transactions that you maintain in the company remain safe. You can enable additional security options for your company to prevent unauthorised access to your transaction records.\n\nIf you have more than one user accessing your company, you can set up security for each user based on their roles.\n\nYou can create an account in TallyPrime for each user. Based on the user’s roles, you can access to the tasks the user can perform.\n\nSay you want to allow a data entry operator to make only transaction entries. You do no want this user to access your financial reports, such as Balance Sheet and P&L. However, you want the user to be able to do back-dated entries when needed. All of these can be done in TallyPrime by creating a user account for the data entry operator role and assigning the necessary rights.\n\nSimilarly, you can create more accounts if you want to maintain multiple users. See [Security and User Profiles](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally/manage-users-in-tallyprime/) to know more about security rights and user roles.\n\n**Multiple companies**: Do you have more than one business? If yes, you can create multiple companies in TallyPrime, maintain transactions separately for each business, and also manage the returns for each company accordingly.\n\n**Group company**: If you are maintaining multiple companies, you can get a consolidated view of such business reports by using the Group Company feature. Viewing the financial reports separately for each business and consolidating the accounts manually can be a tedious task.\n\nOnce you have set up your company in TallyPrime based on your business requirements, you can record and manage your day-to-day transactions, and track them – even remotely.\n\n\\[/expand\\]\n\n## [Create a Company to Record Business Transactions](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/tally-company/set-up-company-tally/\\#create-a-company-tallyprime)\n\nYou need to create a company to keep record of all your business transactions and view related financial reports. To create the company, just enter the company name and address and update other details, such as contact and financial year information.\n\nHow to Create a Company in TallyPrime \\| Tally Learning Hub - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of Tally Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC62ArIQMFhfoIpyFYP5DMSw?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.tallysolutions.com%2F)\n\nTally Solutions\n\n160K subscribers\n\n[How to Create a Company in TallyPrime \\| Tally Learning Hub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow6NXj3PzBo)\n\nTally Solutions\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nMore videos\n\n## More videos\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

On launching TallyPrime, select **Create** **Company**.\n\n   - If you already have one company open and would like to create another company, press **Alt** + **K**(Company) > **Create**.\n2. Provide the Company details.\n\n1. Enter the **Name, Mailing name**, and **Address**. For more information, click here.\n      **Name**: Specify the company name as customers recognise your business in general. In TallyPrime, this name will appear whenever you need to select the company.\n\n      **Mailing Name & Address**: This name & address will be printed in all the [invoices and reports.](https://help.tallysolutions.com/set-up-company-tally/#create-a-company-tallyprime) This can be the same as the company’s name. However, if you want a different name to be printed in your invoices and reports, you can specify a different Mailing Name. For example, you can have your company name as National Enterprises and the mailing name as National Enterprises Pvt Ltd, which is used in all your business communications. If you are billing from different business locations and want to have the corresponding address printed on the bills, you can add more than one address for your company. Refer to [F11 Features](https://help.tallysolutions.com/knowledgebase/business-preferences-company-features-tally/).\n\n      By default, your company data will be saved in the location specified under Company Data Path, which is the same as the folder where TallyPrime is installed. For more information on configuring your data path, refer to [Manage Your Company Data](https://help.tallysolutions.com/knowledgebase/manage-your-company-data-tally/).\n\n2. Enter the **State**, **Country**, and other contact details. A sample image is shown below. These details can be printed on your invoices, if needed. For more information, click here.\n      **Country** and **State**: The Country field is prefilled depending on the country specified during installation of TallyPrime. Select the country applicable to your business and then select the State . If you do not see the State or Country that your business operates from, you can create the State or Country in the application on the fly and select the same. Ensure that your base currency is appropriate.\n\n      **Telephone**, **Mobile**, and **E-mail**: You can configure your bills to include these contact details and print them so that your clients can contact you when needed. You can provide your website address to have it printed on your bills. Your customers can go to your website to know about your products and services in detail.\n\n      [![State and Country in Company Creation](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/company-state-country-tally.jpg)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/company-state-country-tally.jpg)\n3. Accept the screen. As always, you can press **Ctrl+A** to save the details and create the company. You can set up the remaining company details (steps 3 and 4 below) anytime later.\n\n      The name of new union territory Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu is provided in Release 6.6.3. All masters with Daman & Diu and Dadra & Nagar Haveli are automatically updated with the name of new union territory. The state/union territory name before merger is captured in State (before reorganisation) field. Retaining the pre-merger state/union territory name helps in managing transactions and tax returns from that period.\n3. Set up financial year details and security options.\n\n1. **Financial year beginning from**: TallyPrime pre-fills this field based on the date settings of your computer and the Country selected in the **Company Creation** screen. For more information, click here.\n\n      For example, if your computer date is set to 11-03-2020 and the region is set to India, the financial year is pre-filled as 01-04-2020. If you update the company’s country as UAE in TallyPrime, keeping the computer date as is, the financial year for the company is automatically set to 01-01-2021. This is because, TallyPrime considers the computer date and the financial period applicable for the selected country and updates the **Financial year beginning from** field accordingly.\n\n2. **Books beginning from**: By default, TallyPrime fills this field with the **Financial year beginning from** date. You can update this, as needed. Say you started your business and have maintained all business transactions since 1-Oct-2020. You can update the Books beginning from date to 1-Oct-2020, while the financial year will be 1-Apr-2020.\n3. **Enable Edit Log**: This is optional, available from TallyPrime Release 2.1 onwards. You can enable **Set Edit Log applicability** under **F12** and enable Edit Log for the Company. This will help you to view Edit Log for the future activities that you will perform in masters and transactions.\n\n      Furthermore, Company-level activities such as enabling or disabling the Edit Log feature, data migration, or data split that affect the Edit Log report of masters and transactions will be recorded in the Edit Log report under Company.\n4. **Security**: This is optional. You can enable security features such as TallyVault and User controls for your company anytime later.\n\n      If you do not see the Security option, press **F12** (Configure) > set the following options to **Yes**:\n\n      - **Use TallyVault Password to encrypt Company Data**\n      - **Use User Access Control**\n\n         For more information, click here.\n\n        a) **TallyVault**: If you do not want the company name to be displayed in TallyPrime while selecting the company, you can specify a TallyVault password for your company. This encrypts your company and therefore ensures privacy of the company data. You can access this company only if you know this password. This password cannot be retrieved, if lost. Refer to the [TallyVault](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/access-control-data-security/tallyvault-for-company-tally/) topic for details on managing TallyVault.\n\n        b) **User Access**: You can allow authorised user access to your company by setting up a username and password for the company. Which means, next time you select the company, you will need to provide this username and password to open the company data. For different users, you can set up different user credentials for controlled access of your company. Refer to the [Security Controls](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/access-control-data-security/manage-users-in-tallyprime/#enable-security) topic for details on managing users and access rights.\n4. Specify the Base Currency Information.\n\nYou can set up the base currency depending on the currency used in your business to record transactions.\n\nTo view all the options related to base currency, press **F12** (Configure) > set **Provide Additional Base Currency details** to **Yes**.\n\n   - If your business includes transactions in multiple currencies, refer to the [Multi-currency](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/multi-currency/) topic.\n5. Accept the **Company Creation** screen. As always, you can press **Ctrl+A** to save.\n\nSaving the company takes you to the **Company Features** screen, which displays that the company is created successfully.\n\n[![Company Features](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/company-features-tally.jpg)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/company-features-tally.jpg)\n\nIf you have created more than one companies with the same Company Name and have loaded one company, you will not be able to open another company with a duplicate name at the same time. You will first need to close the loaded company and then load the other company.\n\n### [Set up company features](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/tally-company/set-up-company-tally/\\#setupcompanyfeatures)\n\nAs you create a company in TallyPrime, you can set up the necessary features, either now or anytime later, based on your business needs.

Marking a master as Verified or removing the status Verified also creates Edit Log. <br>   <br>   _**Note**_: You may re-accept a voucher or master by pressing **Ctrl+A**. However, the Activity may be displayed as **Altered** due to internal changes in application that occurred due to the activity of resaving. <br>2. **Altered due to Voucher Renumbering**: Insertion or deletion of a voucher affects the voucher number of subsequent vouchers. This leads to the creation of Edit Log. <br>3. **Altered due to Import**: Import of data leads to creation of Edit Log, if there are any differences in the imported transaction or master. <br>4. **Altered due to Split**: Changes made to the masters such as Opening Balances, Bill-wise details, and others during Split will create Edit Log.<br>5. **Altered due to Sync**: Edit Log is created if there are any changes between the transaction or master in the client system and server system. <br>6. **Altered due to Migration**: Transactions and masters that are altered to support the new or improved functionality provided in that release will have Edit Log. |\n| **Deletion** | 1. **Deleted**: When you delete a master, the activity is logged.<br>2. **Deleted due to Sync**: When a deleted master is synchronised from the client system to server system, TallyPrime creates an Edit Log for the activity. |\n| **Resave** | 1. **Resaved (No changes)**: When a transaction or master is saved without making any changes, the activity is logged.<br>2. **Resaved due to Import (No changes)**: When a transaction or master gets resaved at the time of import without any changes, the activity gets logged.<br>3. **Resaved due to Sync (No changes)**: After synchronisation, if there is no change in the master in the server system as compared to the client system, then the activity is logged.<br>4. **Resaved due to Voucher Renumbering**:When a Company data for which Voucher Type with method of voucher number as **Automatic (Manual Override)** is migrated and it is changed to **Automatic** or **Multi-User Auto**. Thereafter, if the voucher numbers do not change, then the vouchers get resaved. |\n| **Previous Record** | You may make a lot of changes in a transaction or a master when Edit Log is disabled in the Company. <br>Previous Record refers to the consolidated data of the activities performed in TallyPrime when the Edit Log is disabled or in a migrated Company data where Edit Log was not enabled.<br>The activity called **Previous Record** gets logged in transactions and masters when they are altered, resaved, deleted for the first time after:<br>- Edit Log is enabled in _TallyPrime Release 2.1_ or later.<br>- The Edit Log is enabled > disabled for sometime > and enabled again. <br>- The data is migrated from _TallyPrime_ _Release 2.1_ or later with Edit Log disabled to _TallyPrime Edit Log Release 2.1_ or later.<br>- The data is migrated from _TallyPrime Release 2.0.1_ or earlier or _Tally.ERP 9_ to _TallyPrime Edit Log_.<br>- The data is moved from _TallyPrime Release 2.0.1_ or earlier or _Tally.ERP 9_to _TallyPrime_ and the user enables Edit Log.<br>Previous Record: <br>- Provides you with the details of a transaction or master at the time Edit Log is enabled.<br>- Does not contain Username and Date & Time, as Edit Log was disabled when the activity was performed<br>**Note**:<br>When you perform the first activity in the imported transaction or master, two activities will get logged.<br>1. **Previous Record**<br>2. The activity that you have performed: Altered, Deleted, or Resaved (No changes). |\n| **Activities with Status: Optional and Status: Cancelled** | There can be activities such as creation, resaving, or alteration with Status: Optional and Status: Cancelled. <br>The statuses are provided for such vouchers because these transactions do not affect your financial reports, until they are made regular. |\n| **[Method of voucher numbering](https://help.tallysolutions.com/set-up-company-tally/#method-of-vch-numbering)** | In TallyPrime Edit Log and TallyPrime Release 3.0 with Edit Log enabled, whenever you change the Method of voucher numbering, TallyPrime displays a message.<br>[![vch-numbering-editlog](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/vch-numbering-editlog.jpg)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/vch-numbering-editlog.jpg)<br>When the method of voucher number is changed, there is a possibility that some vouchers will get renumbered. So, the Vch. No. in those transactions gets altered, which leads to the creation of an Edit Log for those vouchers.<br>Note: You need to consider the impact on taxation and compliance, if any, before changing a voucher numbering method. If the number of vouchers are too many, TallyPrime will take some time to renumber all vouchers.<br>Moreover, you will get the same message as above, if you enable Set/Alter additional numbering details to Yes and change the voucher type configurations. |\n\nIf the Security Control is not enabled in your Company, then the activities will be logged with username as **Unknown (Security not enabled)**.\n\n### [Differences Between Edit Log Versions](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tracking-modifications/\\#differences-between-versions)\n\nWhen you drill down on a version in the Edit Log report for any transaction or master, you can view the differences between the selected version and the immediate previous version.\n\nTallyPrime Release 6.0 onwards, you can also view the changes made in Bank Date, Instrument Number, and Instrument Date. Moreover, you will also get to know if a UPI is changed.\n\n![Differences Between The Edit Log Versions](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-differences-between-edit-log-versions-tallyprime.jpg)\n\nThe values in the reports are organised based on the fields and their hierarchy.\n\nThe field values that have changes between the versions are marked in red, regardless of the users changing the values or internal changes.\n\n#### Keys for specific actions in the report\n\n| Keys/Action | Result |\n| **+**/ **–** | Move between the next and previous versions |\n| **PgDn**/ **PgUp** | Scroll within the report |\n| **Shift+F5** | View the details of the changes |\n| **Shift+Enter**/ **Enter**/double-click | Explode a line |\n| **F12** | Configure the report |\n\n##### A few special cases of the diff report\n\nActivity: **Created**\n\nThe version on the left-hand side is empty and no field value is shown in red.\n\n![Edit Log Report for Created Activity](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-differences-between-edit-log-version-report-deleted-activity-tallyprime.jpg)\n\nActivity: **Deleted**\n\nThe version on the right-hand side is empty and no field value is shown in red.\n\n![Edit Log Report for the Deleted Transactions or Masters](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-differences-between-edit-log-version-report-created-activity-tallyprime.jpg)\n\nActivity: **Resaved (No changes)**\n\n![Drill Down to Differences Between Edit Log Versions for Resaved No Changes Activity](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1-drill-down-to-differences-between-edit-log-versions-resaved-no-changes-tallyprime.jpg)\n\n###### Other cases in Differences Between Edit Log Versions report\n\n| Type | Action/Reason | Impact |\n| User action | Voucher Type changed during alteration | Order of fields in the **Differences Between Edit Log Versions** report will change. |\n| Change in order of ledgers | Order of ledgers in the **Differences Between Edit Log Versions** report will change. |\n| Altered ledgers and then altered vouchers | Changes due to ledger alteration will be shown in the report for the transaction in which the ledger is used. For example, if you change the address in a particular party ledger and then alter a transaction with the ledger, then the values affected due to ledger alteration will start appearing in the Differences Between Edit Log Versions report of the transaction. |\n| Changed the number of decimal places for units | Field values get marked in red, even when the value remains the same. This happens because even if you set the number of decimal places to 2, TallyPrime internally calculates the values with 4 decimal places. |\n| Configuration-based values | Occurrence of disabled field in report | Regardless of enabling or disabling certain features, values related to such features will appear with appropriate default values. For example, even if you have not enabled GST or VAT, then also you will see fields related to GST or VAT. This happens because, irrespective of the status of the feature – enabled or disabled, transactions and masters have those values as a part of the data. |\n| Use of TDLs | Display of User-Defined Fields | If there is any TDL that modifies the field labels and the TDL is not present when loading the report, then the values will be shown without labels. |\n| Data behaviour | Values that are only shown in the voucher but not part of the data | A few fields such as discount percentage and alternate units shown on the voucher for reference are not included in the report. |\n| Nature of Data | Data presentation in the report | The way you see data in the report may change from the way you see in the voucher or master screen. This happens because the way data stored in TallyPrime differs from the way it is presented. |\n\n## [Set Up User Access Control \\| Set/Remove Security Settings](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/tally-company/set-up-company-tally/\\#set-up-security-settings)\n\nSecurity of business transactions and financial reports is critical, especially to avoid misuse or unauthorised access.

      "learning": "Last updated on: December 26, 2025 \\| ⏱ 44 min read\n\nAs per the accounting practice of journaling, you can record all transactions using Journal Vouchers (JV) in TallyPrime. However, there are specialised accounting Voucher Types for different types of transactions like payments, receipts, sales, purchases, contra, debit notes, credit notes, and so on to ease data entry. Once you know how to enter a transaction in TallyPrime, you can enter any transaction in a similar way. Voucher Types in TallyPrime can be categorised as journals, purchases, sales, payments, receipts, contra, inventory vouchers, order vouchers, and non-accounting vouchers. In this topic, you will understand how to record a transaction in TallyPrime or say, do accounting entry in TallyPrime and learn more about the voucher types provided for accounting in TallyPrime.\n\nApart from the 28 default voucher types for accounting entry in TallyPrime, you can also create your own voucher types under the default voucher types for easy accounting. For example, you can create Cash Sales under Sales voucher type so that you can identify and sequentially number all your cash sales.\n\nFor faster data entry operation, you can also use voucher class in TallyPrime.\n\n## Record Transactions\n\nRecording transactions for accounting entry in TallyPrime follow a simple pattern. You can record a transaction with the following steps. A transaction for payment of rent (expenses) is used as an example.\n\n1. Press **Alt** + **G** (Go to) > **Create Voucher** \\> press **F5** (Payment).\n\nAlternatively, **Gateway of Tally** > **Vouchers** \\> press **F5** (Payment).\n2. Press **F2** (Date) to change the transaction date, if needed.\n\nWhen you press **F2** to change the date, the date shown is for the subsequent day of the current date. This is done to avoid manual entry of date for the next day as the immediate next day is the most common business day. You can however enter any date, even a date before the current date.\n3. In the **Account** field, select the **Cash** or Bank ledger.\n\nWhen you create a Company in TallyPrime, the system creates two ledgers by default – **Cash** and **Profit & Loss A/c**.\n4. Provide the payment details.\n1. Under **Particulars**, select expense ledger for which you are making this payment.\n\n      As always, press **Alt+C** to create a ledger under **Indirect Expenses**, on the fly, if an expense ledger does not exist.\n\n2. **Amount**: Enter the payment amount.\n\n      [![Payment Voucher Accounting Entry in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/payment-voucher-tally-1.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/payment-voucher-tally-1.gif)\n5. Provide **Narration**, if any, and accept the voucher creation screen. As always, press **Ctrl+A** to save.\n\n## Edit Log for Transactions\n\nIn TallyPrime Edit Log Release 2.1 and TallyPrime Release 2.1 with [Edit Log](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/edit-log/tracking-modifications/#edit-log-report-for%c2%a0transactions-and-masters) enabled, all the activities related to a particular transaction are recorded as Edit Log for that transaction. These activities include Creation, Alteration, and Deletion which can happen in various scenarios such as changing the rate of the stock item in the transaction, adding narration, changing voucher number, and other such activities that affect the Company data.\n\n_In this section_\n\n- [View Edit Log for transactions](https://help.tallysolutions.com/accounting-entry-tally/#transaction-edit-log)\n- [Impact of re-numbering voucher number](https://help.tallysolutions.com/accounting-entry-tally/#edit-log-voucher-numbering)\n- [Impact of deleting a voucher](https://help.tallysolutions.com/accounting-entry-tally/#edit-log-voucher-deleting)\n- [Impact of other activities](https://help.tallysolutions.com/accounting-entry-tally/#edit-log-voucher-alter)\n\n### View Edit Log for transactions\n\nYou may want to view Edit Log to track changes made in a voucher. To view Edit Log for a transaction:\n\n1. Open the transaction from **Day Book**.\n\n1. Press **Alt+G** (Go To) > type or select **Day Book** and press**Enter**.\n\n      Alternatively, **Gateway of Tally** \\> **Day Book**.\n2. Select the transaction and press **Enter**.\n\n      The **Voucher Alteration** screen appears. If you have opened **Day Book** to view altered/deleted vouchers and drill-down on a deleted transaction, then the **Edit Log** report appears.\n\n      In **Voucher Creation** screen, press **PgUp** to open the previous transaction, and press **Alt+Q** to open **Edit Log**.\n2. In the transaction, press **Alt+Q** (Edit Log).\n\nAlternatively, press **Ctrl+O** (Related Reports) > **Edit Log** and press **Enter**.\n\nThe **Edit Log** report displays **Version**, **Activity**, **Username**, and **Date & Time**.\n\n[![Edit Log in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1-edit-log-transactions-tallyprime.jpg)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1-edit-log-transactions-tallyprime.jpg)\n\nRefer to [Activities Tracked Under Edit Log](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/welcome-to-tally-prime/edit-log/#activities-transactions-masters) to know more.\n3. Select any version and press **Enter**.\n\nThe **Differences Between Edit Log Versions** screen appears.\n\n![Differences Between Edit Log Versions Report](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-differences-between-edit-log-versions-tallyprime.jpg)\n\nYou can view the details of changes made in the selected version of the transaction as compared to its previous version.\n\nTallyPrime highlights the changes made in the transaction as compared to its previous version in red text.\n\nSimilarly, you can drill down to any version and view the comparison between the version and its previous one.\n\nYou will not be able to drill down on the Resaved version as there are no data of changes between the versions.\n\nTo know more about the report, refer to [Differences Between Edit Log Versions](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/welcome-to-tally-prime/edit-log/#differences-between-versions).\n\nYou can also view Edit Log of all the vouchers under a specific voucher type, organised by the voucher date in the [Voucher Type-wise Summary](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally/view-edit-log-summary/#editlog-voucher-type-wise) section in the Edit Log Summary.\n\n4. Configure the report to compare the versions, as needed.\n\n1. Press **F12** (Configure).\n2. **Show altered values only**: **Yes**.\n\n      Subsequently, only the values that you have changed in the transaction will be highlighted in red text.\n\n      For instance, if you had changed Party A/c, Rate of a Stock Item, Date, and others, then you will be able to view it.\n\n      Set it as **No**, if you do not want to view those values.\n3. **Show configuration-based value** **(such as Yes/No, or change from blank to Not Applicable/Primary)**: **Yes**.\n\n      Subsequently, you will be able to view the difference in the configurations of both the versions.\n\n      For instance, If you had changed values of fields which is enabled by the **F12** configurations of the voucher, then you will be able to view it.\n\n      Set it as **No**, if you do not want to view the difference in the configurations of both the versions.\n4. **Show internal fields updated by the application**: **No**.\n\n      As a result of alteration, a few internal fields get updated in the application.\n\n      Set is as **Yes** only if you want to view such fields in the report.\n\n      [![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scenario-managment-memo-tally.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/scenario-managment-memo-tally.gif)\n\n      After configuring, as shown above, a sample report appears as shown below.\n\n      ![Differences Between Edit Log Versions After Configuring](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4-differences-between-edit-log-versions-configured-tallyprime.jpg)\n\n### Impact of re-numbering voucher number\n\nIf the method of voucher numbering is set as Automatic or Multi-user Auto in a particular Voucher Type, then a few activities such as deleting the voucher or changing the date will create a log for the subsequent vouchers.\n\n### Impact of deleting a voucher\n\nWhen you delete a voucher, the following message appears.\n\n![Impact of Deleting a voucher in TallyPrime with Edit Log enabled](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5-deleting-a-voucher-edit-log.jpg)\n\nOnce you delete a voucher, the voucher number of the subsequent vouchers change because of which a log gets created for those vouchers too. However, TallyPrime does not retain the log for deleting an entry/voucher.\n\nTo view the impact of adding, inserting, or duplicating a transaction, refer to [**Add, Insert, or Duplicate a Transaction**](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting-financial-reports/day-book-tally/#add-insert-or-duplicate-a-transaction).\n\n### Impact of other activities\n\nWhen you change the date of a voucher, TallyPrime displays a message.\n\n![Impact of Voucher Renumbering in TallyPrime With Edit Log Enabled](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/6-making-the-voucher-optional-message-tallyprime.jpg)\n\nIf you change the date of a voucher, its voucher number changes. Therefore, the voucher number of the subsequent vouchers also change.\n\nThe change in voucher number leads to the creation of log for those vouchers.\n\nOther activities that can lead to creation of log for affected vouchers due to voucher renumbering are listed below.\n\n1. Making a voucher Optional\n2. Making an Optional voucher a regular one\n3. Changing the voucher type of a voucher\n4. Creating a back-dated transaction\n\nThe message is displayed only when you accept the voucher by pressing **Enter** on the total amount.\n\n## [Accounting with Journal Voucher](https://help.tallysolutions.com/accounting-entry-tally/\\#accounting-with-journal-voucher)\n\nIf you are accounts-savvy, you can use Journal voucher for accounting entry in TallyPrime to record any type of transaction. In a Journal voucher, you will see the By & To/Dr & Cr entries that you are familiar with when doing entries in the account books.\n\nThough you can use JV for any kind of accounting transaction, it needs good knowledge of accounting principles. For ease of recording, you may choose the corresponding specialised voucher type.\n\n_In this section_\n\n- [Record Journal entries](https://help.tallysolutions.com/accounting-entry-tally/#record-journal-voucher)\n- [Record depreciation for Fixed Assets](https://help.tallysolutions.com/accounting-entry-tally/#record-depreciation)\n- [Adjustment entries using Journal vouchers](https://help.tallysolutions.com/accounting-entry-tally/#journal-vouchers-adjustment-entries)\n- [Journal vouchers in day book](https://help.tallysolutions.com/accounting-entry-tally/#journal-vouchers-day-book)\n- [Journal register](https://help.tallysolutions.com/accounting-entry-tally/#journal-register)\n\n### Record Journal entries\n\nYou can use Journal voucher in TallyPrime to record the payment you did in the previous transaction.\n\n1. Press **Alt** + **G** (Go to) > **Create Voucher** \\> press **F7** (Journal).\n\nAlternatively, **Gateway of Tally** > **Vouchers** \\> press **F7** (Journal).\n2. Press **F2** (Date) to change the transaction date, if needed.\n\nWhen you press **F2** to change the date, the date shown is for the subsequent day of the current date. This is done to avoid manual entry of date for the next day as the immediate next day is the most common business day. You can however enter any date, even a date before the current date.\n3. Specify the payment details.\n\n1. In **Dr**, select the expense ledger, and specify the **Debit** amount.\n\n      For example, you can select an Expense ledger for rent and enter the rent paid.\n\n      As in other transactions, you can create the ledger on the fly by pressing **Alt** + **C**.\n\n      By default, in a journal voucher, you need to first specify the Dr (debit side).\n2. In **Cr**, select the payment mode. and specify the **Credit** amount.\n\n      If you are unable to see the **Cash** ledger, click on Show More under **List of Ledger Accounts**.\n\n      If the amount is not equivalent to the debit amount, you need to select another Credit ledger.\n\n      [![Journal Voucher Accounting Entry in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/journal-entry-accounting-expenss-tally.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/journal-entry-accounting-expenss-tally.gif)\n4. Provide **Narration**, if any, and accept the voucher creation screen. As always, press **Ctrl+A** to save.\n\nYou have recorded a **Payment** transaction in TallyPrime as a Journal entry. In a similar manner, you can use a **Journal** voucher to record any type of accounting transaction.\n\nAs you have seen, though you can use a **Journal** voucher in TallyPrime to record a payment transaction, the specialised voucher type **Payment** helps ease the data entry.\n\n### [Record depreciation for Fixed Assets](https://help.tallysolutions.com/accounting-entry-tally/\\#record-depreciation)\n\nIn TallyPrime you can record the depreciation of fixed assets using a journal voucher. To do this, create a Depreciation ledger under **Indirect Expenses**.\n\n1. Press **Alt+G** (Go To) > **Create Voucher** \\> press **F7** (Journal).\n\n2. Select the Depreciation ledger in the Debit field, and enter the depreciation amount in the Amount field.\n\n3. Credit the fixed asset ledger for which depreciation is recorded. The credit amount appears automatically.\n\nThe **Accounting Voucher Creation** screen appears as shown below:\n\n[![Depreciation](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/c57330c6-d16e-44c4-b55b-2382af5957e4.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/c57330c6-d16e-44c4-b55b-2382af5957e4.png)\n\n4. Save the journal voucher by pressing Ctrl+A.\n\nYou can record the journal voucher at the end of each month or year. Further, you may create separate depreciation ledgers for individual fixed assets or maintain a single ledger to record depreciation for all fixed assets.\n\nThe **Depreciation Chart** provides a periodic break-up of depreciation amounts for one or more assets. This chart can be generated by maintaining **Cost Categories** and **Cost Centres**.\n\nTo view a periodic depreciation chart, create a **Cost Category** and **Cost Centres** using the following hierarchy:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Cost Category** | **Under** |\n| Depreciation | Primary Cost Category |\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Cost Centre** | **Select Category** | **Under** |\n| Fixed Assets | Depreciation | Primary |\n| April | Depreciation | Fixed Assets |\n| May | Depreciation | Fixed Assets |\n\nIn this example, **Fixed Assets** represents the assets for which depreciation has to be recorded. If you want to track depreciation separately for individual assets, create separate cost centres for each asset. The months represent the reporting periods.\n\nOnce this hierarchy is set, allocate the depreciation amount in the journal voucher to the **Cost Category (Depreciation)** and the respective **Cost Centre (e.g., July)**.\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/accounting-faq1-tally.gif)\n\nThis set of ledgers and cost centres created in a hierarchy will give you the Depreciation Chart. You can view the same from Cost Category Summary.\n\n- Press **Alt+G** (Go To) > type or select **Cost Category Summary** \\> and press **Ente** r.\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/accounting-faq3a-tally.gif)\n\n### Adjustment entries using Journal Vouchers\n\nIf you have understanding of accounting principles, you can use JV for any kind of accounting transactions, including adjustment entries. JVs are mostly used for adjustment entries for finalisation of books.\n\n### Journal Vouchers in Day Book\n\nTo view entered Journal vouchers, you can go to Day Book.

Such fund transfers from one account to the other – say Cash A/c to Bank A/c or vice versa – appear on the same side of the company’s balance sheet, and do not impact your company books. This does not include transferring money to any third-party account as part of a payment.

As always, you can press **Ctrl+** **A** to save.\n\n### Use Reversing Journal Voucher in Scenarios\n\nRecording transactions for accounting entry in TallyPrime follow a simple pattern. You can record a transaction with the following steps. Since provision for depreciation is made at the end of the year, you can create scenarios to include them for monthly reporting or a specific period to give more accurate status or position.\n\n1. Press **Alt** + **G** (Go to) > **Create Voucher** \\> press **F10** (Other vouchers) > type or select **Reversing Journal**.\n\nAlternatively, **Gateway of Tally** \\> **Vouchers** \\> press **F10** (Other vouchers) > type or select **Reversing Journal**.\n2. In case the voucher is inactive, you will be prompted to activate the Reversing Journal voucher type. Select **Yes** or press **Y** to proceed.\n3. If you want to change the voucher date, press **F2** (Date).\n\nWhen you press **F2** to change the date, the date shown is for the subsequent day of the current date. This is done to avoid manual entry of date for the next day as the immediate next day is the most common business day. You can however enter any date, even a date before the current date.\n4. In **Dr**(Debit) side, select Depreciation and specify the amount.\n\nAs in other transactions, you can create the ledger on the fly by pressing **Alt** + **C**. Alternatively, press **Alt** + **G**(Go To) > **Create Master** \\> type or select **Ledger** \\> and press **Enter**.\n5. In **Cr** side, select Provision on Depreciation and specify the amount.\n\nIf the amount is not equivalent to the debit amount, you need to select another Credit ledger.

Provide **Narration**, if any, and accept the voucher. As always, you can use **Ctrl** + **A** to accept.\n\n### Use Scenarios in Reports\n\nYou can use scenarios in statements (not registers) to compare the actuals with the provisional details by using the **Alt+C** (New Column) button.\n\n1. Press **Alt** + **G**(Go to) > type or select **Balance Sheet** \\> and press **Enter**.\n\nAlternatively, **Gateway of Tally** > **Balance Sheet**.\n2. Press **Alt** + **C** (New Column).\n3. Select the scenario required. The Balance Sheet with the scenario appears as shown below: [![Scenarios in Report in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/reversing-journal-scenario-balance-sheet-tally.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/reversing-journal-scenario-balance-sheet-tally.gif)\n\n## [Mark Vouchers as Optional](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/accounting-entry-tally\\#optional-vouchers)\n\nAny voucher in TallyPrime can be marked as Optional by pressing Ctrl+L (Optional) during voucher entry or in alteration mode.\n\nMarking voucher as Optional will remove the accounting impact of the transactions from the books of account. Some transactions are recurring in nature like rent, repayment of loan, and so on. You can pass all such transactions and mark them as optional. Once the actual date of such transaction occurs you can regularise the transaction by opening it and pressing Ctrl+L (Regular).\n\nRecording transactions in TallyPrime follow a simple pattern. You can use an example – On 15th August you want to view the Balance Sheet as of that date, but August rent is not due for payment until the first week of September. This liability is not reflected in the Balance Sheet. To overcome this, enter an Optional Voucher dated 15th August.\n\n1. Press Ctrl+L (Optional) to make the voucher as Optional Voucher.\n2. Pass the Debit – Rent Account and Credit – Cash/Bank Account.\n3. Accept the screen.

Press **Enter** on the selected period to view the Voucher Register report. All the Optional vouchers recorded in that period are displayed in this report. You can view them from the **Day Book** as well.\n\n### Creation of Scenarios for Optional\n\nHow to create Scenario for Optional? It follows the same process as the [Creation of Scenarios for Reversing Journal](https://help.tallysolutions.com/accounting-entry-tally/#scenarios-reversing-journals).\n\nIn the Balance Sheet, to see the impact of Optional vouchers you need to use Scenario created for Optional voucher.\n\nUse Scenarios to see the effect of Optional voucher entries on reports and statements.\n\n## [Mark Vouchers as Post-Dated](https://help.tallysolutions.com/accounting-entry-tally/\\#post-dated-vouchers)\n\nWhile entering vouchers, you can mark them as post-dated, as a result these vouchers are not updated in the ledgers till the date specified in the voucher. After you pass a voucher, when the DATE OF LAST ENTRY surpasses the Post-Dated voucher, it gets updated automatically. This is useful for entering transactions that take place on a regular basis. For example, if you issue post-dated cheques towards payment of installments, you can set up the payments in advance, and TallyPrime will only update them in the ledgers on the due date.\n\nMark vouchers Post-Dated by pressing **Ctrl** + **T** (Post-Dated) button from the Button Bar. This button toggles with Current.\n\nPost-Dated Payment Voucher entry is displayed as shown:\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/post-dated-voucher-tally.gif)\n\n_In this section_\n\n- [Post-dated Vouchers Register](https://help.tallysolutions.com/accounting-entry-tally/#post-dated-vouhers-register)\n- [Including Post-Dated Vouchers in Ledger Vouchers Report](https://help.tallysolutions.com/accounting-entry-tally/#post-dated-vouchers-report)\n\n### Post-dated Vouchers Register\n\nAll Post-dated vouchers are maintained in a **Post-Dated voucher Register**.\n\n1.

Press **Enter** on the selected period to view the Voucher Register report. All the Post-Dated vouchers recorded in that period are displayed in this report.\n\nThe major difference between post dated vouchers and other unconventional vouchers are:\n\n- Post-Dated Vouchers affect regular books of accounts on the date of the voucher.\n- Post-Dated vouchers are not available for selection in Scenarios.\n\n### Including Post-dated Vouchers in Ledger Vouchers Report\n\nUsing the ledger option under the Accounts Book in TallyPrime, you can include post-dated vouchers in the ledger voucher report.\n\n1. Press **Alt** + **G**(Go to) > type or select **Ledger Voucher** \\> and press **Enter**.\n\nAlternatively, **Gateway of Tally** \\> **Display More Reports** > **Account Books** \\> **Ledger**.\n2. Select the required Ledger. The **Ledger Vouchers** screen appears.\n3. Press **Alt** + **F8** (Incl Post-Dated) to include the values for post-dated transactions in the report. The voucher number of these transactions will have the prefix (Post-Dated), and the period of the report will automatically include the date of the post-dated transaction.

Used Voucher class aids in faster data entry, appropriate allocation of stock item to ledgers, helps eliminate mistakes of wrong ledger selection, and invoice level rounding. You cannot use a voucher class in voucher alteration.\n\n### Use voucher classes for Sales & Purchases cycles\n\nA sample voucher class creation for sales transaction is as given below. You can use separate voucher classes for each type of sales for error-free and faster data entry while ensuring the following.\n\n- Selection of appropriate party in each type of sale.\n- Usage of specific ledgers for accounting allocation of stock items.\n- Inclusion of appropriate tax ledgers in the voucher by default.\n- Uniform calculation of additional charges.\n- Application of similar invoice level rounding off.\n\n### Create voucher class for sales or purchase\n\n01. Press **Alt** + **G**(Go to) > **Alter Master** \\> type or select **Voucher Type** \\> **Sales** \\> and press **Enter**.\n\n    Alternatively, **Gateway of Tally** \\> **Alter** \\> type or select **Voucher Type** \\> **Sales** \\> and press **Enter**.\n02. Enter the **Name of Class** and identify the parties for which the class can be used. If you do not see this option use **F12** (Configure) to get the option. [![Create Voucher Class in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/creating-voucher-class-tally.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/creating-voucher-class-tally.gif)\n\n03. Under **Include these Groups**, select the required group to be made available in Party A/c Name while creating vouchers. Alternatively, you can use **Exclude these Groups** if the number of groups to exclude is lesser.\n04. Allocate the accounting ledger for stock items.\n\n    [![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/voucher-class-include-group-tally.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/voucher-class-include-group-tally.gif)\n\n05. Select the sales ledger to allocate stock items and set the allocation percentage. You can also select other ledgers along with sales and divide the stock item allocation among the selected ledgers. If tax ledgers need not be shown separately in the voucher, you can include those here.\n06. Set **Override using Item Default** to **No** so that for all items the allocation is to the selected ledger. In case you want to use the default allocation in the stock item master for some cases, set **Override using Item Default** to **Yes**.\n\n    [![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/voucher-class-default-accounting-allocation-tally.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/voucher-class-default-accounting-allocation-tally.gif)\n\n    This screen shows the allocation of items with 5% commission, where the rate includes commission.\n\n    The allocation shown is calculated as “Sales = (100/105)\\*100 = 95.238” and “CGST & SGST = ((100/105)\\*5)/2 = 4.762”\n\n07. Set the **Additional accounting entries** like tax, transportation charge, loading charge, and invoice rounding off.\n08. Select the additional ledgers to be included in the voucher, to avoid selection each time. Include tax ledgers at the end of the list to ensure that tax gets calculated for the other additional ledgers.\n09. Select the **Type of Calculation**. If you select As **User Defined Value**, you need to enter the value during voucher entry. For GST ledgers, automatically the **Type of Calculation** is set as GST. In all other cases you need to provide the **Value Basis** for calculation.\n10. Set **Remove if Zero** as needed.\n\n    [![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/voucher-class-additional-entries-tally.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/voucher-class-additional-entries-tally.gif)\n\n    Here, different ledgers are used, and the ledgers will not be shown in the invoice if the calculated value is zero as **Remove if Zero** is set to **Yes**.\n\n    When using voucher class you cannot select additional ledgers during transaction.\n\n    In a similar way, you can create a voucher class for a purchase voucher type. In case of interest, the calculation is not needed for credit notes and debit notes. You can create voucher classes for these two in the same way. If you have setup your ledger for interest calculation, your sales transactions automatically calculates the interest accordingly and the same gets reflected in the [Interest Calculation](https://help.tallysolutions.com/interest-calculation-tally/) reports.\n\n### Record Sales or Purchase transactions using voucher class\n\nUsing a voucher class for a sample transaction (sales voucher) is as follows.\n\n1. Press **Alt** + **G**(Go to) > **Create Voucher** \\> press **F8**(Sales).\n\nAlternatively, **Gateway of Tally** \\> **Vouchers** \\> press **F8**(Sales).\n2. Select the voucher class and the party. You can select only the parties satisfying the condition set in the voucher class.\n3. Enter the item details.\n\nThe ledgers specified in the voucher class are displayed. You can enter the values, or the values are calculated as set in the voucher class. In case tax ledgers are included in the voucher class, taxes are calculated as per ledger definition.\n\n[![Record Transactions Using Voucher Class in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sales-voucher-class-tally.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sales-voucher-class-tally.gif)\n\n4. Provide **Narration**, if any, and accept the sales voucher screen. As always, you can press **Ctrl** + **A** to save.\n\nIn a similar way you can use voucher classes for creating sales order, purchase, purchase order, delivery notes, and receipt notes.\n\n### Use voucher classes for Receipts, Payments and Contra entries\n\nUse voucher classes for receipts to pre-fill the specific source of money as cash or bank. Similarly, you can specify the destination of money in the case of payments and contra entries.\n\nThe following image shows a sample voucher class for cash Payments using a Payment Voucher Type.\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/voucher-class-cash-payment-tally.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/voucher-class-cash-payment-tally.gif)\n\n### Related Topics\n\n- [How to Record GST Payment Entry in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tax-payment/)\n- [Journal Entry for GST Adjustment in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/india-gst-journal-vouchers-in-gst-tally/)\n- [Flexibilities in TallyPrime to Ensure Accuracy and Ease of Data Entry under GST](https://help.tallysolutions.com/flexibilities-in-tallyprime-under-gst/)\n- [Accounting & Inventory](https://help.tallysolutions.com/accounting-inventory/)\n- [How to Record Advance Payments Under GST in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/india-gst-advance-payments-gst-reverse-charge-tally/)\n\n[_𝕏_](https://twitter.com/home?status=https://help.tallysolutions.com/accounting-entry-tally/) [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://help.tallysolutions.com/accounting-entry-tally/ \"facebook\")\n\n![TallyHelpwhatsAppbanner](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Have-another-Query-Desktop-version.jpg)![TallyHelpwhatsAppbanner](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Have-another-Query-Mobile-version.jpg)\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/close-1.png)\n\nIs this information useful?\n\nYesNo\n\nOn this page\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Helpful_icon.png)Helpful?\n\nDidn't find what you are looking for?

In double entry mode, you need to decide which account to debit and which account to credit. You can use double entry mode if you are familiar with the accounting rules.

You need to debit the expense ledgers one after the other along with their corresponding amounts and credit the cash, bank, or petty cash account from where you are making the payment.\n\nYou can record all entries in double-entry mode by selecting the ledger to be debited and credited correctly.

In this example, we are recording payment of regular business expenses through Petty Cash.\n\nIn TallyPrime, when you switch a voucher to double-entry mode, this setting will be saved, and all future vouchers will open in double-entry mode by default.

The sale of goods involves the transfer of physical items, while the sale of services involves the transfer of intangible items, such as knowledge or expertise. Once the goods or services are sold you need to record those transactions. After recording the transactions, you can print the sales invoice. You can configure your sales voucher and cancel the vouchers, if needed. Any modifications made to the recorded transactions can also be tracked.\n\nEvery business involves the sales of goods or services which can be either cash or credit sales. As part of the business practice, you can print the invoice and share it with your customer. In case you have recorded a sale which is incorrect, you can cancel such vouchers.\n\nTallyPrime provides you with the option to record sales of goods and services in different modes.

Alternatively, if you want to track the sale of different products through different ledger accounts, then you can disable this option. Using the common ledger for item allocation speeds up the recording of transactions, as you do not have to select the sales ledger every time you select a stock item. |\n| Use Cr/Dr instead of To/By during voucher entry | In As Voucher mode, you have the option to record transactions using To/By or Dr/Cr. By default, the voucher mode opens with To/By, you can enable this option to use Dr/Cr instead. |\n| Use default Bill-wise details for Bill Allocation. | Automatically allocates bill numbers as defined in the Voucher Type master. |\n| Provide Additional Descriptions for Ledgers | Specify any additional description for the ledger during voucher entry. For example, suppose you record all employee conveyance in a single Conveyance ledger. At the time of recording the voucher, you can provide the name of the employee against the conveyance ledger for future reference. |\n| Provide Additional Descriptions for Stock Items | During the voucher entry process, specify any additional descriptions for the stock item. For example, if you are selling a mobile phone, you can mention the storage capacity of that phone as part of the additional descriptions for the stock item. |\n| Warn on Negative Stock Balance | When there is insufficient stock during sales entry, a warning message of negative stock with quantity details appears. You can either update the stock first and then record the sale, or you can proceed with the sales entry and adjust the quantity of the item when the stock is updated. |\n| Show Inventory details | In the As Voucher mode, you can enable this option to view the item details sold along with its rate in the voucher. |\n| Use Voucher No. as Bill<br>Reference for Bill Allocation | When allocating bills, you can use the voucher number as the bill reference number. This makes it easier to find the invoices that you need to pay or collect to/from your creditors and debtors. |\n| Modify all fields during<br>voucher entry | Modify all fields in the sales invoice. |\n| Provide details to preclose orders | Pre-close orders partially or completely from the Stock Item Allocation screen. |\n| Select Cost Centre/Class | Display the cost centre details for any additional ledger. If you need to track any additional ledger such as transportation expenses separately from the stock item or service ledger, you can use cost centres. If you have created a cost centre class, then you can select that as well while recording the voucher. |\n| Show list of Bills for selection | You can view all the pending lists of bills both for your debtors and creditors if you enable this option. |\n| Show Final Balances for each Bill | Along with the list of bills, you can also view the final balances of each bill mentioned in the Bill allocation screen. |\n| Show Bill-wise Details | The bill-wise breakup of pending bills reflects in the voucher if the option is enabled. |\n| Show Bill-wise details in multiple lines | In the voucher, if you are adjusting multiple bills, then this option shows multiple lines of the bill-wise breakup of pending bills. |\n| Show Cost Centre details | In As Voucher mode, this option displays the cost centre details in the voucher. |\n| Provide Reference No.<br>and Date | Specify the Reference No. and Date in the invoice. You can use the voucher number and date as the reference no and date. The same reference no you can use for bill allocation. |\n| Warn on negative Cash Balance | TallyPrime prompts a warning message during the recording of cash payment if the cash balance becomes negative. This helps you to decide whether to proceed with the entry or not. |\n| Skip the Date field during voucher creation | The Date field is prefilled with the date of the last transaction, and the cursor skips this field. You can change the date by pressing **F2**. |\n| Warn when Voucher No. exceeds 16 characters | TallyPrime prompts a warning message when Voucher No. exceeds 16 characters. This option is used in case of GST, where the voucher number format must not exceed 16 characters. But for non-GST transactions also you can maintain the same format. |\n| Show Turnover from selected Party A/c | During voucher entry, along with the customer’s current balance, you can also see how much business your customer has given to you. |\n| Show Current Balance of Ledgers | Display the current account balance of the party ledger. |\n| Show Balances as on Voucher date | Display the account balance of the party as on the voucher date. If this option is enabled, the party ledger shows the voucher date balance instead of the net account balance. |\n| Show final Ledger Balance | Display the account balance of the party ledger just below the Party A/c name field. |\n| Consolidate Qty of Stock Items with same rate | Suppose you have two delivery notes for the same product with the same rate sold to the same customer then by enabling this option, you can consolidate delivery notes and issue one invoice with the quantities merged. |\n| Show Compound Unit based on Rate | You can record the sale of stock items with the compound unit and use the first set of units for quantity and the second set of units for rate. If you enable this option, the unit for the quantity gets changed to the rate unit. |\n| Show details of Compound Unit | Display full details of the compound unit in the Quantity field. |\n| Provide Marks or Container No. | Specify container information for items for export. |\n| Provide No. of Packages | Specify the number and package type for items for export. |\n| Use default Bank Allocations | You can enable this option to set the bank allocation details for each receipt or payment. Choose the transaction type and update the Instrument date and it automatically takes the voucher date as the instrument date which you can change manually, if required. |\n| Remove Bank Date while altering Reconciled Voucher | If you need to alter any voucher after the reconciliation is done, then you can enable this option to remove the Bank date from the reconciled voucher. The bank date is the date when your amount is cleared from the bank. |\n| Calculate Tax on Current Subtotal<br>(else calculations are on inventory total only) | If you enable this option, then the tax is calculated after including any additional charges like transportation. Otherwise, the tax is calculated on the item total. |\n\n## [Reports \\| Know Your Sales](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/sales-process/sales-of-goods-services-tally/\\#reports_sales)\n\nIn your business, once the recording of sales of goods and services is done, you may want to see all the transactions on a single screen.

You can record a Purchase Order in TallyPrime to raise such demand indicating the types, quantities, and agreed prices for products or services. It controls the purchasing of products and services from external suppliers. Similarly, once you have received the goods, you can record a Receipt Note in TallyPrime to account for the goods received and against the existing Purchase Order as well. You can view your purchase bills that are pending and also pre-close orders via partial cancellation or complete cancellation as well.\n\nWhen the order is placed with the suppliers for the supply of goods, the items, quantities, order due date, and so on, details are given with the Purchase Order Number. Later, when these goods are received, the Purchase Order is tracked for the Order Details in the Receipt Note or in the Purchase invoice based on your preferred business practices. If you follow the Order>Receipt Note>Purchase flow or Order>Purchase flow, TallyPrime gives you the flexibility to follow your preferred practices as they are.\n\nThe Outstanding Purchase Order reports are available in TallyPrime. Also, knowing the order position of any item in the Stock Summary is possible.

Learn about the predefined ledgers in TallyPrime, and along with that learn to create ledgers for different contexts. After you create the ledgers, you can alter or delete them. You can track the altered or deleted ledgers. Finally, you can learn to view the report showing the transactions of your ledgers.\n\nIn your business, you record each transaction, and later such transactions are classified into separate accounts and get posted to the ledger. Each account has, an opening balance or carry forward balance, transactions recorded either as debit or credit and a closing balance. Ledgers contain the necessary information to prepare financial statements. The ledgers in TallyPrime or in the Books of Accounts affect assets, liabilities, income, or expenses. Once the transactions are posted to the ledgers, considering the closing balance of each account the Trial Balance is prepared. TallyPrime provides flexibility to the users to generate Profit & Loss A/c and Balance Sheet. It can also generate a range of comprehensive financial statements and reports.\n\nIn TallyPrime, there are two predefined ledgers, Cash & Profit and Loss accounts. Apart from the predefined ledgers, you can create as many ledgers as required for your business. You can create the ledgers before recording the transactions. In case you come across a new expense head or a new debtor or creditor while recording the transaction, then you can also create the ledger while you are recording them. Apart from creating a ledger, you can also alter or delete them as per the need.\n\nYou can view the Ledger vouchers report in the browser and also view, print, or export the opening balance of all ledgers.  In TallyPrime, you also have the option to track changes made to the ledgers through Edit Log.\n\n## [Predefined Ledgers in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/ledgers-in-tallyprime/\\#predefined-ledger)\n\nIn TallyPrime, there are two predefined ledgers, Cash & Profit and Loss accounts.

      "title": "Groups in TallyPrime",
      "learning": "Last updated on: October 31, 2025 \\| ⏱ 28 min read\n\nIn any business, it is important to categorise similar ledgers based on their nature, type, or usage under an accounting head. In TallyPrime, such accounting heads are known as Groups. You can create, alter, and delete Groups in TallyPrime along with copying Groups from one company to another. Furthermore, in TallyPrime you can view the created Groups with all the transactions in multiple reports.\n\nGroups help you organise the ledger accounts and view the financial statements with proper accounting heads. It can be classified between Assets, Liabilities, Expenses, and Incomes. Any Groups created under Assets and Liabilities form a part of the Balance Sheet whereas Groups under Expenses and Incomes are part of the Profit & Loss Account.\n\nIn TallyPrime, there are 28 predefined groups, of which 15 are Primary and 13 are Subgroups. Along with the predefined groups, you can create new Groups to accommodate your business needs.\n\nAfter creating the Groups, if you want to alter the Group for an existing ledger then you can do that as well. Suppose you have created wages under the group Direct Expense, and you want to change the Group to Indirect Expense. You can alter the ledger account and change the Group for that ledger. TallyPrime also allows you to delete unused or unwanted Groups, if any. All these changes and deletions of Groups can be tracked if you have enabled the Edit Log option.\n\nIf you have multiple companies and want to maintain a similar group structure and uniformity across the companies, then you can copy Groups from one company to another either one at a time or all at once.\n\nApart from these, you can configure advanced options for Groups and make the Groups behave as sub-ledgers. With all these options, it becomes absolutely necessary to view the groups on a single page. TallyPrime provides solutions to that need as well by displaying reports such as Group Summary and Group Voucher.\n\n## [Pre-Defined Groups](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/groups-in-tallyprime/\\#pre-defined-groups)\n\nThere are 28 predefined groups in TallyPrime. These groups are part of the Chart of Accounts for most organizations. For example, Sales Accounts are a predefined group. All sales ledgers can be classified into this group.\n\nOut of the 28 predefined groups, 15 are primary groups of which nine Primary groups appear in the Balance Sheet that are capital in nature and six Primary groups appear under Profit & Loss A/c, which are revenue in nature and 13 are subgroups which are shown below. You can create any number of primary groups and subgroups but Primary groups in TallyPrime cannot be deleted.\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Primary | Under | Subgroups | Under |\n| Branch/Divisions | Balance Sheet | Bank Accounts | Current Assets |\n| Capital Account | Balance Sheet | Bank OD A/c | Loans (Liability) |\n| Current Assets | Balance Sheet | Cash-in-hand | Current Assets |\n| Current Liabilities | Balance Sheet | Deposits (Asset) | Current Assets |\n| Direct Expenses | Profit & Loss A/c | Duties & Taxes | Current Liabilities |\n| Direct Incomes | Profit & Loss A/c | Loans & Advances (Asset) | Current Assets |\n| Fixed Assets | Balance Sheet | Provisions | Current Liabilities |\n| Indirect Expenses | Profit & Loss A/c | Reserves & Surplus | Capital Account |\n| Indirect Incomes | Profit & Loss A/c | Secured Loans | Loans (Liability) |\n| Investments | Balance Sheet | Stock-in-hand | Current Assets |\n| Loans (Liability) | Balance Sheet | Sundry Creditors | Current Liabilities |\n| Misc. Expenses (ASSET) | Balance Sheet | Sundry Debtors | Current Assets |\n| Purchase Accounts | Profit & Loss A/c | Unsecured Loans | Loans (Liability) |\n| Sales Accounts | Profit & Loss A/c |  |  |\n| Suspense A/c | Balance Sheet |  |  |\n\n## [Default Groups](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/groups-in-tallyprime/\\#default-groups)\n\nThere are a number of default Groups in TallyPrime that can be used for various accounts. For detailed information on Default Groups, click here.\n\n.\n\n### [Capital Account](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/groups-in-tallyprime/\\#capital-account)\n\nA Capital Account is a group under which the Owner’s capital, Partner’s capital, and similar ledger accounts are created to record the amount contributed by the owner or partner to start the business. In the case of companies, this account is shown as shareholder’s equity.  It also records the retained earnings. In TallyPrime, Groups created under Capital Account record the Capital of the company. The ledgers that belong to Capital Accounts are Share Capital, Partners’ Capital A/c, Proprietor’s Capital Account, and so on.\n\n### [Reserves and Surplus \\[Retained Earnings\\]](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/groups-in-tallyprime/\\#reserves-surplus)\n\nReserves are the amount set aside by the owner to use in the future for buying fixed assets, company expansion, legal requirements, or any investment. The funds are kept aside so that the cash or bank is not used for any of these expenses. On the other hand, a Surplus is an excess of income after all expenses are met. This Group contains ledgers like Capital Reserve, General Reserve, Reserve for Depreciation, and so on.\n\n### [Current Assets](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/groups-in-tallyprime/\\#current-assets)\n\nA Current Asset is an asset that a company can easily sell and convert into liquid cash. The Current Assets help to meet the daily business expenses and help to maintain the working capital of the business. There are many subgroups created under this group, like Bank or Cash accounts, Deposits, Loans & Advances, Sundry Debtors, and even stocks.\n\n- **Bank Accounts**: This subgroup shows all the Bank accounts like Current accounts, savings accounts, short-term deposit accounts, and so on.\n- **Cash-in hand**: In TallyPrime, Cash A/c is a predefined ledger created under this group. You can open more than one cash account, if needed.\n\nAn account under the Cash-in-Hand group or Bank Accounts/Bank OCC A/c group is printed as a separate Cash Book in the traditional Cash Book format and does not form part of the Ledger.\n\n- **Deposits (Asset)**: Deposits contain Fixed Deposits, Security Deposits, or any deposit made by the company (not received by the company, which is a liability) that the company will get back after its maturity or at the end of the service.\n- **Loans & Advances (Asset)**: This records all loans given by the company and advances of a non-trading nature (for example advance against salaries). We do not recommend you to open Advances to Supplier account under this Group. For further details, please refer to the section on [Common Errors.](https://help.tallysolutions.com/groups-in-tallyprime/#common-possible-errors)\n- **Stock-in-Hand**: This group contains accounts like Raw Materials, Work-in-Progress, and Finished Goods. The balance control depends on whether you have selected the Integrated Account-cum-Inventory option while creating the company. Refer to the [Company creation](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/tally-company/set-up-company-tally/#create-company) section under the [Set Up Your Company](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/tally-company/set-up-company-tally) topic for more details.\n\nLet us consider these options:\n\n  - **Integrated Accounts with Inventory**: This option has a significant effect on the Balance Sheet and Profit & Loss A/c. When set to Yes, it pulls the stock/inventory balance figures from the inventory records and allows you to drill down to the stock registers from the balance sheet. You are not allowed to directly change the closing balance of an account under this group. You are allowed to pass transactions in Inventory records, and the account balances are automatically reflected in the Balance Sheet as Closing Stock.\n  - **Non-integrated Accounts with Inventory**: If **Integrate Accounts with Inventory** option is set to No, it ignores the inventory book figures and picks up manually entered closing stock balances from the ledger account created. This provides the facility to maintain accounts separately and inventory separately. You are not allowed to pass transactions if your accounts fall under this Group. It allows you to hold opening and closing balances only. Since no vouchers can be passed for these accounts, they are the only accounts for which the closing balances can be directly altered (this can be done with due diligence by a responsible person).\n\n- **Sundry Debtors**: Sundry Debtors are grouped with the persons or company who have bought the goods or services on credit and is liable to pay the business in the future.\n\n### [Current Liabilities](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/groups-in-tallyprime/\\#current-liabilities)\n\nCurrent Liabilities are obligations that must be paid as soon as they become due. The Current Liabilities are paid by liquidating the Current Assets. Hence, it is important to keep a check on the liability and ensure that the business has sufficient money to pay the liability as and when it becomes due. Accounts like Outstanding Liabilities, Statutory Liabilities, and other minor liabilities can be created directly under this group. Sub-groups under Current Liabilities are Duties and Taxes, Provisions, and Sundry Creditors.\n\n- **Duties & Taxes**: Duties & Taxes contain all tax accounts like GST, VAT, CENVAT, Excise, Sales, and other trade taxes and the total liability (or asset in case of advances paid) and the break-up of individual items.\n- **Provisions**: Accounts like Provision for Taxation, Provision for Depreciation, and so on are recorded under Provisions.\n- **Sundry Creditors**: Sundry Creditors are grouped with the persons or companies from whom the goods or services are purchased on credit and are liable to receive from the business in the future.\n\n### [Investments](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/groups-in-tallyprime/\\#investments)\n\nGroup your investment accounts like Investments in Shares, Bonds, Govt. securities, long-term Bank deposit accounts, and so on. This allows you to view the total investments made by the company.\n\n### [Loans (Liability)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/groups-in-tallyprime/\\#loans)\n\nLoans that a company has borrowed are typically long-term loans.\n\n- **Bank OD Accounts \\[Bank OCC Accounts\\]**: TallyPrime provides you with distinct types of Bank Accounts. This is used to record the company’s overdraft accounts with banks; for example, Bill Discounted A/c’s and Hypothecation A/c’s, etc.\n\nAn account under Bank OCC A/c group is printed as a separate Cash Book in the traditional Cash Book format and does not form part of the ledger.\n\n- **Secured Loans**: Term loans or other long/medium term loans obtained against the security of some asset do not verify the existence of the security. Typical accounts are Debentures, Term Loans, and so on.\n- **Unsecured Loans**: Loans obtained without any security. Example: Loans from Directors/partners or outside parties.\n\n### [Suspense Account](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/groups-in-tallyprime/\\#suspense-account)\n\nIn modern accounting, many large corporations use a Suspense Ledger to track the money paid or recovered, the nature of which is not yet known. The most common example is money paid for Traveling Advance whose details will be known only upon submission of the Travelling Allowance bill. Some companies may prefer to open such accounts under Suspense Account.\n\nThe Suspense Account is a Balance Sheet item. Any expense account, even if it has ‘suspense’ in its name, should be opened under the Revenue group like Indirect Expenses and not under the Suspense Account group.\n\n### [Miscellaneous Expenses (Asset)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/groups-in-tallyprime/\\#miscellaneous-expenses)\n\nThis group is typically used for legal disclosure requirements such as Schedule VI of the Indian Companies Act. It should cover incorporation and pre-operative expenses. Companies would write off a permissible portion of the account every year. A balance remains to an extent that cannot be written off in Profit & Loss Account. TallyPrime does not show a loss, carried forward in the Profit & Loss Account, under this group. The balance of the Profit & Loss Account is displayed separately in the Balance Sheet.\n\n### [Branch/Divisions](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/groups-in-tallyprime/\\#branch-divisions)\n\nThis maintains ledger accounts for all your company’s branches, divisions, affiliates, sister concerns, subsidiaries, and so on. TallyPrime permits Sales and Purchase transactions to take place with accounts opened here. Remember, these are their accounts in your books, not their books of accounts. Just treat them like any other party account. If you wish to maintain the books of a branch or division on your computer, you must open a separate company. TallyPrime allows the maintenance of multiple company accounts.\n\n### [Sales Account](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/groups-in-tallyprime/\\#sales-account)\n\nYou can classify your sales accounts based on different types of sales.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Domestic Sales\n- Export Sales\n\nYou can even open an account as Sales Returns under the group Domestic Sales to view your net sales after returns (or the returns may be directly passed through Journal against the specific Sales account).\n\nDo not create customer accounts under this group. For more details, refer to the section on [Common Errors.](https://help.tallysolutions.com/groups-in-tallyprime/#common-possible-errors)\n\n### [Purchase Account](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/groups-in-tallyprime/\\#purchase-account)\n\nThis is similar to sales accounts, except for the type of transactions.\n\n### [Direct Income \\[Income Direct\\]](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/groups-in-tallyprime/\\#direct-income)\n\nThese are non-trade income accounts that affect Gross Profit. All trade income accounts fall under Sales Accounts. You may also use this group for accounts like Servicing, Contract Charges that follow sales of equipment.\n\nFor a professional services company, you may not use the Sales Account group at all. Instead, open accounts like Professional Fees under this group.\n\n### [Indirect Income \\[Income Indirect\\]](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/groups-in-tallyprime/\\#indirect-income)\n\nThese are miscellaneous non-sale income accounts; for example, Rent Received and Interest Received.\n\n### [Direct Expenses \\[Expenses Direct\\]](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/groups-in-tallyprime/\\#direct-expenses)\n\nThese are Manufacturing or direct trading expenses. These accounts determine the Gross Profit of the company.\n\n### [Indirect Expenses \\[Expenses Indirect\\]](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/groups-in-tallyprime/\\#indirect-expenses)\n\nThis group includes all administrative, selling, or non-direct expenses.\n\nProfit & Loss A/c is a reserved primary account in TallyPrime. You can use this account to pass adjustment entries through journal vouchers. For example, transfer of profit or loss account to Capital or Reserve account.\n\n### [Common and Possible Errors in Grouping and Account Classification](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/groups-in-tallyprime/\\#common-possible-errors)\n\nDebtor/Creditor classification\n\nAccounts of parties with whom your company is trading should be opened under any of the following groups in TallyPrime (or sub-groups under them):\n\n- Sundry Debtors\n- Sundry Creditors\n- Branch/Divisions\n\nSales and Purchase account groups are meant for revenue accounts and are reflected in the Profit & Loss A/c. If you open party accounts under these groups, it becomes difficult to pass sales or purchase voucher transactions.\n\nFor example, in a sales voucher transaction entry, you must debit an account, which can be a sundry debtor, branch/division, or even a sundry creditor. Moreover, other facilities like bill-wise allocation and tracking will not be available unless the accounts belong to one of these groups in TallyPrime.\n\n### [Opening two accounts for a same party](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/groups-in-tallyprime/\\#two-accounts-for-a-party)\n\nIn TallyPrime you can classify debtors, creditors, and branch/divisions at your convenience. This helps you in the process of keeping the accounts of a particular group together during display and analysis. Use the classification depending on the most natural group for the party.\n\nFor example, parties from whom you buy frequently can be placed under Sundry Creditors, as that is the natural place to look for their account. TallyPrime does not restrict the accounts from having obverse balances. Thus, a Sundry Debtor can have a credit balance depending on the state of his account.\n\nTherefore, you need not open two accounts for the same party – one under Sundry Debtors and another under Sundry Creditors. TallyPrime restricts the opening of two identical ledger accounts. In such cases, you may decide to mark one account as “A & Co – S/Dr” and another as “A & Co – S/Cr”. This will allow you to have two accounts of the same party under two groups, but you will lose the advantage of analyzing the net position at a single instance. It is always better to maintain a single account to obtain the best benefits.\n\nSimply adhering to the reserved groups may be sufficient for many organizations. For greater diversity, TallyPrime allows you to create your own groups, either as sub-groups or Primary groups. Groups can be sub-classified to practically an unlimited level, giving you a virtual accounting tree. At the lowest level, of course, it would be the ledger account.\n\nWhile it is necessary to assign every ledger to a group/sub-group, it is not essential to have your own sub-classification of accounts; you may simply use the reserved groups for grouping your ledger accounts.\n\n## [Create, Alter, and Delete Account Groups](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/groups-in-tallyprime/\\#create-alter-delete-groups)\n\nYou can create single or multiple groups in TallyPrime and configure the details per your requirement. You can also view, alter, or delete these groups in TallyPrime, as needed.\n\n_In this section_\n\n- [Create account groups](https://help.tallysolutions.com/groups-in-tallyprime/#create-groups)\n- [View and alter groups](https://help.tallysolutions.com/groups-in-tallyprime/#view-alter-groups)\n- [Delete Groups](https://help.tallysolutions.com/groups-in-tallyprime/#delete-group)\n- [View Edit Log for groups](https://help.tallysolutions.com/groups-in-tallyprime/#accounting-group-edit-log)\n\n### [Create account groups](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/groups-in-tallyprime/\\#create-groups)\n\nBy default, TallyPrime provides you twenty-eight predefined account groups, and you can create any ledger under these twenty-eight groups. You create a ledger and assign it to a particular group. The ledger will function as per the configurations set for the group. For example, if you run a factory, you can assign ledgers for labour charges and raw materials-related expenses under the Direct expense group. Say, you are a food influencer, who likes to promote his business on social media. So, you can keep computer and internet expenses under the Indirect expense group. Therefore, based on the group you have opted for, your ledger will function.\n\nHowever, there may arise a situation when you need to have a group that suits your business needs as the ledgers you wish to create don’t come under any of the twenty-eight predefined groups in TallyPrime. TallyPrime provides you with two possible solutions, creating sub-groups under the predefined groups and creating independent Primary groups.\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](https://youtu.be/MWmfSqrDfIQ)\n\n### **Create sub-groups under the predefined account groups**\n\nTo make ledger organization and identification easier, create sub-groups under existing predefined groups. For example, if you have a group called Sundry Debtors for the parties you sell to, you can divide it into zones like East, West, North, and South. Each of these zones will be a sub-group under Sundry Debtors. TallyPrime will then display ledger properties based on these sub-groups. While the Sundry Debtors group will be split into four sub-groups, the total value will still be consolidated at the Sundry Debtors level.  The inherent capability of the parent group will get carried forward to the sub-groups.\n\n1.

Press Alt+G (Go To) > **Create Master** \\> **Currency** \\> and press **Enter**.\n\nAlternatively, **Gateway of Tally** \\> **Create** \\> **Currency** \\> and press **Enter**.\n\nThe **Currency Creation** screen appears.\n\nWhen only the base currency is available, you will be prompted to create a new currency or alter the existing currency. Select **Create** or press **C** to create a new currency.\n\n2. Specify the currency details.\n\n1. **Symbol**: Enter the currencysymbol.\n\n      This symbol appears in your transactions.\n\n      From TallyPrime Release 7.0, you can now use the official currency symbols for UAE (Dirham) and KSA (Saudi Riyal).\n\n      To know the shortcut to add the new symbol, refer to [Keyboard Shortcut.](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/keyboard-shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-tally-prime/#shortcuts-currency)\n\n2. **Formal name**: Enter the name of the currency accepted globally.\n\n      For example, enter US Dollars to distinguish different currencies having the same symbol.\n\n      If you have two companies (ABC & XYZ) in TallyPrime, then you can set different currencies for both the companies. ABC uses symbol $ for Australian Dollars and XYZ uses the symbol $ for U.S. Dollars. The formal name distinguishes two different currencies with the same symbol, which helps when you compare the books of accounts for both the companies. The company that is loaded first retains the original symbol for display purposes. The other company’s currency symbol will be prefixed with the first letter/first few letters (to make it unique) of the formal name. Here, if ABC is loaded first then the symbol $ is for Australian Dollars and in XYZ (loaded next) the symbol $ is prefixed with the letter U (first letter of its formal name).\n\n      You cannot assign a duplicate **Formal name** for a currency.\n3. **ISO Currency Code**: Enter the standardised three-letter alphabetic identifier for the currency, which clearly and consistently represents the currency in international transactions. You may refer to the [codes published by IBAN](https://www.iban.com/currency-codes).\n3. **Number of decimal places**: Enter the number of decimal places, based on the practice you follow in your business.\n4. Set the option **Show amounts in millions** to **Yes** or **No,** as needed.\n5. **Suffix symbol to amount**: **Yes**.\n\nThis ensures that the symbol appears after the amount.\n6. **Add space between amount and symbol**: **Yes**.\n7. Specify details for the word representing amount after decimal.\n\n1. Enter the **Word representing amount after decimal**, for example, Paise.\n2. Enter the **No. of decimal places for amounts in words**.\n\n      This number should be equal to or lesser than the number specified in **Number of decimal places** field.\n\n      ![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/create-currency-tally-2-300x204.gif)\n8.

So, you may have sold a particular set of items or provided service at a certain rate of exchange on a date or time and received payment for the same on a different date or time. In such cases, the rate of exchange may not be necessarily the same at both the points in time. So, your business may experience forex gain or loss due to the fluctuation rate of exchange.\n\nTo understanding this, let us take an example.\n\nConsider that your base currency in TallyPrime is INR and the other currency in which the transaction is carried out is USD.\n\nNow, you sold a set of items on 11-May-2022 to a specific customer based in the U.S., and the total amount was $100.\n\nOn 11-May-2022, the rate of exchange was INR 70 per USD, which makes the total amount INR 7000.\n\nThe customer makes the payment at a different time on 11-May-2022, 12-May-2022, or later, and the rate of exchange changes to INR 71 per USD.\n\nThe change in rate of exchange makes the final billing amount INR 7100.\n\nSo, you made a forex gain of INR 100 on the transaction.\n\nIn TallyPrime, you can see such gains and losses as Unadjusted Forex Gain/Loss in Balance Sheet. As per accounting standard, you will need to record a transaction to account for such forex gains or losses. TallyPrime gives you easy way to record these transactions.\n\n#### Create a ledger for forex gain or loss\n\nTo account for forex gain or loss, you need to create a ledger under **Indirect Expenses** or **Indirect Income** in TallyPrime.\n\nSubsequently, you can use the ledger in the **Voucher Class** using which you can account for forex gain or loss.\n\n#### Create Journal Voucher Class\n\nOnce you create a ledger, you can create a **Journal Voucher Class** in TallyPrime with that pre-defined ledger. Thereafter, you can record your forex gain or loss using the **Voucher Class**.\n\nYou can create multiple **Journal Voucher Class** for multiple currencies, if needed.\n\n1.

      "title": "Job Costing in TallyPrime",
      "learning": "Last updated on: October 31, 2025 \\| ⏱ 18 min read\n\nJob costing is a systematic method of analyzing your expenses and incomes when you take up certain projects or jobs as per a client’s specifications and requirements. TallyPrime enables you to effectively manage the costs incurred for a project, thereby ensuring better tracking of the revenues associated with one or more jobs. Starting from acquiring raw materials to producing and delivering the materials to a client, TallyPrime helps you deal with Job costing efficiently, even if you are handling more than one job at a single point in time.\n\nDuring the completion of a job, any direct or indirect expenses will be termed as the cost of completing the project or job. Meanwhile, any direct or indirect income generated will be recorded as the Revenue of your company. As a part of your job requirement, your expenses might include:\n\n- Procurement and transfer of the raw materials to the factory or warehouse.\n- Consumption and transfer of the finished products to godowns.\n- Additional charges, such as packaging, wear and tear, and so on.\n\nKnowing the expenses incurred against each of the deliverables can help you visualize your incomes more effectively.\n\n**Allocate and Track project costs and revenues**: Using the job costing feature in TallyPrime, you can now allocate and track all the expenses as well as the revenues made towards completing a project. You might have used cost centres to allocate different expenses and godowns to manage the raw materials and finished goods. TallyPrime handles tracking of stock consumption godown-wise or location-wise and allocated costs seamlessly. It also tracks the costs involving procurement, movement, and consumption of raw materials. What’s more? If you are managing multiple projects at the same time, TallyPrime facilitates use of Stock Journal Voucher Classes to simplify your data entry while effectively reflecting your overall cost and revenue from each project.\n\n**View project costs in reports**: When you handle multiple projects at a time, it is necessary that you track the expenses and income of individual projects or jobs. Since, one project or job might fetch higher profit margins than the other, a job-level costing is necessary to prevent one job’s profit from overlapping the loss incurred in another job. You can view the Job Work Analysis report in TallyPrime to get a crux of all your expenses incurred and incomes generated by individual projects/jobs and determine the Nett profit or loss. TallyPrime provides different reports to analyse the project costs and expenses, thereby enabling you to make informed business decisions.\n\n**Compare inward and outward revenue flow**: In TallyPrime, you can also compare your inward and outward flow of revenues, in addition to giving you an insight of the profitable and unprofitable projects. Such an insight will help you analyze and ascertain the cost of similar jobs to be undertaken in the future.\n\n## Setup TallyPrime for Job Costing\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](http://youtube.com/watch?v=2XgalhSpnKE)\n\nIn TallyPrime, enabling Job Costing and Cost Centres are prerequisites for using the Job Costing feature. Since your project or job is spread across multiple sites, creating godowns is mandatory to track the location-wise material movement and finances associated with each project or job. Stock Journal Voucher Classes can be created to define the type of material movement in your project or job sites. You can select whether the material movement involves only transfer, or if the material is being consumed at the source location to produce finished goods at the destination location, by selecting either Transfer or Consumption as the class respectively.\n\nLet’s say you have undertaken two projects namely, Project Amara and Project Prestige, where you need to deliver finely cut and polished 2×2 and 3×3 sizes of granite tiles. You strike a deal with Universal Enterprises, a granite supplier in Rajasthan who sells fine quality granite slabs at lesser prices. Both the projects will require 5,000 sq.ft of raw granite each. Since the truck can accommodate 12,000 sq.ft. of slabs, you decide to purchase an extra 2,000 sq.ft. of granite and store it in the Main Location Godown. Then you transfer the raw materials from HSR layout Godown to Electronic City Godown for Project Amara and from Koramangala Godown to Whitefield Godown for Project Prestige. The granite is consumed in these destination godowns and the required sizes of granite tiles are produced. Post this, the granite tiles are sent to Electronic City Godown for Project Amara and Whitefield Godown for Project Prestige from where they’ll finally be sold off to the clients.\n\n1.

Then you can plan on obtaining the required raw materials from different sources and start the production process. The price of raw materials will have a direct impact on the project or job; therefore, you must deal with suppliers who will supply you the materials at reasonable rates without compromising on the quality of the materials. Since your business requires bulk purchasing of materials, you can negotiate with suppliers for providing better rates. Once the materials are procured, you can get ahead with the production process.\n\nThe two projects you have undertaken as mentioned in the example, will require you to purchase 10,000 sq.ft. of uncut raw granite slab.\n\nYou can record the purchase transaction in the following manner:\n\n1. Open Purchase voucher in **As Voucher** mode.\n\n1. Press **Alt+G** (Go To) > **Create Voucher** \\> press **F9**(Purchase).\n\n      Alternatively, **Gateway of Tally** > **Vouchers** \\> press **F9**(Purchase).\n2.

As always, you can press **Ctrl+A** to save.\n\nTo know more about how to record purchase entries, refer to the [Record Purchase Order](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/purchase-process/purchase-order-tally/#purchase-order-receipt-note) topic.\n\n## Movement and Consumption of Materials\n\nTransferring raw materials from one site to another is a common aspect when the project is spread across different locations. There might be an immediate requirement for some goods which might not be readily available at your disposal. Or you may have unused stock for the required item at some other Godown which you can utilise here. In this case, the material will have to be transferred from the main location to the desired one. Similarly, the raw materials may be consumed at one site leading to the production of finished goods.\n\nWhen the same material is being transferred from the source location to the destination location, it is termed as inter-godown transfer of materials. In contrary, when the material utilised in the location leads to the production of finished goods, it is referred to as Consumption of the materials in the given location. You can create voucher classes based on whether the material movement involves only transfer or consumption of the materials. The materials in the Source (Consumption) and Destination (Production)sides cannot be the same when you select Consumption as the Class. With TallyPrime, you will be able to record the inter-location transfer of materials and track its consumption as well.\n\n_In this section_\n\n- Record Inter-Godown Transfer of Materials\n- Record Consumption of Materials\n\n### Record Inter-Godown Transfer of Materials\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](http://youtube.com/watch?v=5XWwvuHa2Qo)\n\nFor Project Amara, when you are shipping the huge uncut raw granite slabs from HSR Godown to Electronic City Godown, there is transfer of material taking place. Therefore, you selectTransfer as the voucher class and Electronic City Godown as the destination location to record the Inter-Godown Transfer of the uncut granite slabs.\n\nTo record the transfer of material,\n\n1. Press **Alt+G** (Go To) > **Create Voucher** > **Vouchers** \\> press **F10** (Other Vouchers) > type or select **Stock Journal** and press **Enter**.\n\nAlternatively, **Gateway of Tally** > **Vouchers** \\> press **F10** (Other Vouchers) > type or select **Stock Journal** and press **Enter**.\n2.

Here the uncut granite slabs are consumed to produce finely cut and polished 2×2 and 3×3 tiles which will be finally sold off to the clients. On selecting Consumption as the voucher class, you will derive the entire overview of the consumption of raw materials and the production of finished goods in the Electronic City Godown including the specific quantities, rates and amount of the materials consumed and produced at both ends.\n\nTo record the consumption of materials,\n\n1. Press **Alt+G** (Go To) > **Create Voucher** > **Vouchers** \\> press **F10** (Other Vouchers) > type or select **Stock Journal** and press **Enter**.\n\nAlternatively, **Gateway of Tally** > **Vouchers** \\> press **F10** (Other Vouchers) > type or select **Stock Journal** and press **Enter**.\n\n2.

Accept the screen. As always, you can press **Ctrl+A** to save.\n\nYou can easily record the consumption of materials after specifying the Voucher class as Consumption and track the material usage.\n\n## Allocate Costs to Projects\n\nBudget Allocation is a significant aspect while planning a project or assigning a job. Since every job or project undergoes varied stages before completion, there are different direct and indirect costs associated with it. You can allocate the costs to individual jobs or projects and track them. Any kind of payment that you make for the project will be termed as Expense. It is possible that you do not pay the creditors immediately and adjust the payment later. In such a case, record a journal voucher to accrue your expense made for the project or job. An overview of these finances will help you in planning your resources and managing your budget.\n\n### Accrue your Expenses\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](http://youtube.com/watch?v=jv3c6UNe_bw)\n\nWhen you are shipping the materials from one godown to another, you will incur certain costs like loading or unloading charges for the materials, transportation costs and so on, which is payable later.  In such cases, you can book your expenses by recording a Journal Voucher.\n\n1. Press **Alt+G** (Go To) > **Create Voucher** \\> press **F7**(Journal).\n\nAlternatively, **Gateway of Tally** > **Vouchers** \\> press **F7**(Journal).\n2. Record the Journal Voucher.\n\n1.

You pay the workers for cutting the edges of the marbles, polishing and loading/unloading materials. The labour payments you make count as direct expenses in your project, and you can record the payment voucher in the following manner:\n\n1.

As always, you can press **Ctrl+A** to save the voucher.\n\nThis is how you record the payment and allocate it to the undertaken project or job.\n\n## Allocate Revenue to Projects\n\nAny income that is generated via the projects can be allocated as their Revenue. You can allocate revenue to individual jobs or projects and track them. As the project progresses in phases, you are left with finely cut and polished 2×2 and 3×3 granite tiles. Income is earned by selling off the tiles to the clients. You may also have left-over granite from each bulk purchase intended to address specific projects. You can even sell these off in scrapyards and earn revenue.\n\n### Record Sales for Revenue\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](http://youtube.com/watch?v=klrGqblKaG0)\n\nYou can record the sales transaction of the tiles and allocate the revenue to the project.\n\n1.

From the **List of Jobs/Projects**, select the job or project that you wish to analyse, for example Project Amara.\n\nThe **Job Work Analysis** report appears, as shown below:\n\n[![Job-Work-Analysis](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/job-work-analysis-report.jpg)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/job-work-analysis-report.jpg)\n\nAny form of direct or indirect source of income is listed under **Revenue** **(Income)**.  Similarly, any direct or indirect expenses incurred while completing the project is listed under **Cost (Expenses)**. The **Nett Profit/Loss** section indicates that this project has generated profit for your business. You can now plan things around each financial aspect and control expenses while the project is still in progress.\n\n```\nNote: Cost centres enabled for job costing will be available for selection in the Job Work Analysis report.\n```\n\n**Ctrl+B**(Basis of Values): The report is set to appear in the Default **Scale Factor**. However, you can alter the view of the Amount section by selecting from the **List of Scale Factors**.\n\n**Ctrl+H**(Change View):You can view related reports such as **Monthly Summary**, **Breakup of Job/Project** and **Job/Project Summary** in this section.\n\n- **Monthly Summary**: The report will display a month-wise summary of the cost and revenue involved in the selected job/project.\n- **Breakup of Job/Project**: The breakup of the costs and revenue will be displayed according to the Accounting Groups involved in the job/project.\n- **Job/Project Summary**: An overall summary of costs and income of the job/project will be displayed.\n\n**Ctrl+J**(Exceptions Report):All the **Negative Ledgers** can be viewed under this section.\n\n**Alt+C**(New Column): You can track and compare the **Revenue**, **Expenses** and **Nett Profit/Loss** by defining the columns as per your business requirements. You can press **Alt+A**(Alter), **Alt+D**(Delete) and  **Alt+N** (Auto Column) to set columns on a weekly, monthly and so on, basis as well.\n\nTo know which project has garnered more profitability than the other, you can compare the **Nett Profit/Loss** of both the projects side-by-side. While you are viewing the **Job Work Analysis** report,\n\n- Press **Alt+C**(New Column), enter the From and To dates and select the project or job with which you want to make the comparison, for example Project Prestige.\n\n[![Job-Work](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/job-work-comparison.jpg)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/job-work-comparison.jpg)\n\nThe report displays both your projects side-by-side in a columnar format. The comparison indicates that despite selling the same quality of granite tiles to both the clients, at the same rate, Project Amara is a more profitable project than Project Prestige. This can be accounted to the overhead charges levied in the latter. With this information, you will be able to decide that investing in which project turned out to be more profitable to your business and how you can cut costs for upcoming projects.\n\nTo know more about reports in TallyPrime, refer to [Working with Reports](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/welcome-to-tally-prime/working-with-reports/).\n\n### Related Topics\n\n- [Job Work in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/job-work-tally/)\n- [How to Manage Inventory in Manufacturing](https://help.tallysolutions.com/manage-inventory-in-manufacturing-tally/)\n- [How to Track Item Cost in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/track-item-cost-tally/)\n- [How to Manage Your Stock Items in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/manage-stock-item-tally/)\n- [How to Track Your Inventory using Stock Summary in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/track-your-inventory-stock-summary-tally/)\n\n[_𝕏_](https://twitter.com/home?status=https://help.tallysolutions.com/job-costing-tally/) [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://help.tallysolutions.com/job-costing-tally/ \"facebook\")\n\n![TallyHelpwhatsAppbanner](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Have-another-Query-Desktop-version.jpg)![TallyHelpwhatsAppbanner](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Have-another-Query-Mobile-version.jpg)\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/close-1.png)\n\nIs this information useful?\n\nYesNo\n\nOn this page\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Helpful_icon.png)Helpful?\n\nDidn't find what you are looking for?

      "title": "Getting Started with GST in TallyPrime",
      "learning": "Last updated on: June 16, 2025 \\| ⏱ 41 min read\n\nOnce you have packed [the essentials](https://help.tallysolutions.com/essentials-for-your-gst-journey/) for your GST journey, TallyPrime is here to ensure that your journey goes as smoothly as possible. This article will show you how you can easily get started with GST in TallyPrime.\n\n#### Enable GST\n\nLet us begin with a few baby steps. First and foremost, you will have to enable GST in TallyPrime and save the details of your GST registration in the Company. These details, such as State, GSTIN/UIN, and so on, will be reflected in your transactions, and you can easily print them in your invoices.\n\nMoreover, your business might have multiple GST registrations (GSTINs) to cater to multiple branches or units, which are an integral part of your own company. TallyPrime understands your special needs, and accordingly it allows you to conveniently save the details of all your registrations in the same company. After saving the details, you can select the relevant registration while recording transactions, and also view the combined financial reports for all your GST registrations. What’s more, you can also file your GST returns based on the required registrations.\n\n#### Set Up GST Rates and HSN/SAC Details\n\nThe next order of business is setting up GST rates. You can easily save these details in TallyPrime, according to the nature of goods or services that your business deals with. TallyPrime offers you the flexibility to apply these rates at various levels, depending on your comfort and business requirements. For example, you can configure the GST rates up front for your company, or you can apply the rates directly in the transaction.\n\nWhat’s more, TallyPrime will also help you select the source or order in which you want to apply the tax rates. For example, if some of your stock items belong to a single stock group and fall under a common tax rate, then you can directly set the tax rate in the stock group. This rate will be subsequently applied to all the corresponding stock items. Moreover, you will always have a clear idea of where the rates are being applied from, by opening GST – Tax Analysis from the transactions.\n\nSimilarly, you can set up HSN/SAC details at different levels, and also override these details in transactions, if needed\n\n#### Set Up GST Details for Parties\n\nOnce you have set up the GST details for your company, it is time to save the GST details for your parties as well.TallyPrime will help you create ledgers for all your customers or suppliers, and store the required details, such as GSTIN/UIN, Registration Type, Place of Supply, Assessee of Other Territory information, and so on.\n\nMoreover, TallyPrime also provides you with the option to maintain a common party ledger across transactions. If you do not want to maintain GST details (such as GSTIN) for all your parties separately, then you can create a common party ledger and enter the GST details directly in the transaction. Even if you have saved certain details in the common party ledger, you will have the option to override them in the transaction.\n\nWhat’s more, with TallyPrime you can specify the Effective Date for any change in the party details, and also view the history of the registration details at any point in time.\n\n#### Set Voucher Numbering\n\nTallyPrime will also help you comply with department guidelines for maintaining GST transactions. For example, the department requires sequential voucher numbering for your GST invoices, and accordingly TallyPrime will help you in easily creating and maintaining multiple series of voucher numbers.\n\n#### Create or Update Masters for GST\n\nTallyPrime also provides you with a host of other masters and ledgers that will help you record your GST transactions in peace. For example, you have sales and purchase ledgers for GST, GST duty ledgers, service ledgers, expense/income/round-off ledgers, discount ledgers, and so on.\n\nMoreover, TallyPrime also provides you with the option to use your ledgers in a flexible manner, depending on your needs. For example, you can use a non-tax ledger (such as Direct Expenses) as a Duties and Taxes ledger. If you are a composition dealer, then you can use a Direct Expenses ledger to record tax details, such as the type and percentage of tax. This will help you calculate and apply taxes easily in your transactions, while also recording the tax as a cost or Direct Expense in your financial records. Similarly, you have the flexibility to use Current Assets and Current Liabilities for either sales or purchases, depending on your business requirements. TallyPrime provides you with the freedom to use your masters and ledgers based on the way your business operates.\n\n## [Enable GST for Your Company – Single and Multi-Registration](https://help.tallysolutions.com/india-gst-start-using-gst-compliance-tally/\\#single-and-multi-gst)\n\nTo use GST in TallyPrime, you have to first enable GST for your company. After that, you can easily save the GST details such as State, GSTIN/UIN, Registration Type, and so on. Once these details are saved in the company GST Details, they will be reflected in your GST transactions. Once GST is activated in the Company, GST-related features will be available in ledgers, stock items, and transactions, and you can conveniently generate GST returns for your business.\n\nFurthermore, if your company has multiple GST registrations (GSTINs), then you can conveniently save the details of all your registrations within the same company, and select the relevant registration while recording transactions. All the transactions for your GST registrations will be saved in the same company, and accordingly you can easily view the combined financial reports for all your registrations.\n\n1. Open the company and press **F11** > **Enable Goods and Services Tax (GST)** > **Yes**.\n2. Press **F12** and enable the required options. You will find configurations related to Place of Supply, Reconciliation, LUT/Bond, and so on.\n\n[![Reconciliation Configuration](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/reconciliation-configuration-1.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/reconciliation-configuration-1.png)\n3. Fill in the relevant details for GST registration:\n1. **State**: The State selected during Company Creation will be reflected here. If you update the State here, it will also be updated in the Company and existing transactions.\n2. **Registration type**: You can select the Registration type as Regular, Composition, or Regular – SEZ, as per your original GST registration with the department.\n3. **Assessee of Other Territory**: If your business is located in an Exclusive Economic Zone (Other Territory). then you can enable this option. GST details will be applied accordingly in your masters and transactions.\n4. **Periodicity of GSTR-1**: Select the Periodicity of GSTR1 as Monthly or Quarterly, based on the annual turnover of your business. To know more about periodicity and other filing details, refer to [our blog](https://tallysolutions.com/gst/new-simplified-gst-retun-filing-model-approved/).\n5. **Reconciliation Configuration**: A few options have been provided to help you with a smooth GST reconciliation. You can enable them based on your business preferences.\n\n      1. **Use Voucher No. & Date as Supplier Invoice No. & Date**: Once you enable this option, the Voucher No. and Date will be considered as the Supplier Invoice No. and Date during reconciliation. In other words, even if you have not provided the Supplier Invoice No. and Date, then you don’t have to worry, as the Voucher No. and Date will be considered.\n      2. **Ignore zero (0) if prefixed in Supplier Document No.**: If your business does not prefix zeroes in the Document No., but your supplier follows this practice, then this might lead to a mismatch during reconciliation. However, once you enable this option, then the prefixed zeroes will be ignored, and you won’t have to worry about a mismatch.\n      3. **Ignore special characters if used in Supplier Document No.**: If your supplier prefers to use special characters, such as hyphen and slash, in the document number, then it might cause issues during reconciliation. However, once you enable this option, such special characters will be ignored and you will have a smooth reconciliation.\n      4. **Ignore difference in Taxable Amount**: In some cases, the taxable value in your transactions might not exactly match the value of the invoice uploaded by your supplier on the GST portal. However, once you enable this option, the system will ignore differences in taxable value and only consider the tax amount to reconcile vouchers automatically.\n      5. **Mark Reconciled vouchers as Accepted in IMS**: When you download invoices from the GST portal, many invoices are automatically reconciled by TallyPrime based on the matching details. Before downloading IMS Inwards invoices, you can enable this configuration and all your reconciled invoices in the IMS Inward Supplies report will be marked as accepted.\n6. **Registration Name**: This will be derived from the State selected earlier. For example, if you have selected Karnataka, then the Registration Name will appear as Karnataka Registration for easy identification. However, you will have the option to rename the registration, as needed. For example, if you have many branches or GST registrations in Karnataka, you can name the branches as Bengaluru Branch, Mangalore Branch, and so on.\n\n7. **Create another GST Registration for the Company**: Use this option to save multiple GST registrations within the same company. After saving the details, you can select the relevant registration while recording transactions, wherever needed. You can also create multiple registrations for your company from the **Gateway of Tally** or **Go To** > **Create Master** > **GST Registration**.\n\n      ![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Enable-GST-Multi-Registration-1.png)\n4.

Alternatively, you can choose a different level such as ledger, accounting group, stock item, stock group, or even apply the rates directly in the transaction.\n\nApart from setting up GST rates at multiple levels, you have the additional benefit of deciding the order in which you want to apply the rates. You can select either the ledger or the stock item as the primary source for applying GST rates, and choose one of the following two orders:\n\n- **Ledger (Default)**: Ledger > Accounting Group > Stock Item > Stock Group > Company\n- **Stock Item**: Stock Item > Stock Group > Ledger > Accounting Group > Company\n\nIn both of the above orders, Ledger refers to Sales or Purchase ledgers.\n\n### [Apply GST Rate and HSN/SAC Details in the Company](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/gst-master-setup/india-gst-start-using-gst-compliance-tally/\\#apply-gst-hsn-sac-company)\n\n1.

Additional Configuration:\n\n      1. **Source of GST rate details in transactions**: This options helps you decide the order in which you want to apply the rates. You can select either the ledger or the stock item as the primary source for applying GST rates, and choose one of the following two orders:\n\n         - **Ledger**: Ledger > Accounting Group > Stock Item > Stock Group > Company\n         - **Stock Item**: Stock Item > Stock Group > Ledger > Accounting Group > Company\n\n           ![](https://tallywiki.tallysolutions.com/download/attachments/131527300/image2022-4-27_19-30-48.png?version=1&modificationDate=1651068048000&api=v2)\n\n           The GST rate will be applied in the selected order.

If you select the Automatic method of voucher numbering, then you also have the benefit of either retaining the original voucher numbers or renumbering the vouchers. Subsequently, while recording transactions, you can select the relevant voucher type, and then the voucher number series will be automatically selected.\n\nMoreover, if your business consists of multiple GST registrations, then you can create and maintain unique voucher numbering series for all your GST registrations. For example, using a single series for sales, you can maintain and track both sales transactions and sales returns. While creating or altering a numbering series, you can set the Series Name and Method of Voucher Numbering.\n\nWhat’s more, you can also choose to use a common series for all your registrations. You can set this option from the Company Features (Set/Alter Company GST Rate and Other Details \\> Use common voucher numbering series for all GST Registrations).\n\n### [Configure Voucher Numbering for GST](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/gst-master-setup/india-gst-start-using-gst-compliance-tally/\\#configure-voucher-numbering-gst)\n\n1. **Gateway of Tally** > **Create/Alter** > **Voucher Type**.\n\nAlternatively, press **Alt+G** (Go To) > **Create/Alter Master** > **Voucher Type**.\n2.

Configure voucher numbering:\n\n1. **Method of Voucher Numbering**: Select the required method as per your business and GST requirements.\n2. **Numbering behaviour on insertion/deletion**: You will see this option if you have selected Automatic or Multi-user Auto as the Method of Voucher Numbering. Generally, when you insert or delete a transaction, your existing voucher numbers might get affected. However, you now have the option to either retain the original voucher numbers or renumber the vouchers, as per your requirement.\n3. **Show unused vch nos. in transactions for Retain Original Voucher No. behaviour**: When you delete transactions or mark them as optional, then the corresponding voucher numbers might remain unused. This option will help you view such unused voucher numbers during voucher entry and reuse the numbers, as required.\n\n      This option will appear when you have set the numbering behaviour as **Retain Original Voucher No.**.\n\n      ![](https://tallywiki.tallysolutions.com/download/attachments/131527300/image2022-5-6_15-50-32.png?version=1&modificationDate=1651832432000&api=v2)\n4.

      "title": "Group Company",
      "learning": "Last updated on: December 17, 2024 \\| ⏱ 6 min read\n\nIf your business consists of branches, subsidiaries, sister, and member companies, it can become difficult to monitor the health of your business group. You might have questions like how your business is doing inclusively, or how your different branches are performing. With its Group Company feature, TallyPrime will help you find answers to all these questions and more. You can create a group company and add as many member companies as you want, in just a few simple steps.\n\nYou can create a group company in TallyPrime to conveniently view all your companies at one place. The group company can function as a single economic entity, where financial reports such as Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss A/c, and Trial Balance are consolidated without any impact on the transactions. Irrespective of whether your branches use the same GSTIN or multiple GSTINs, your data will be seamlessly consolidated.\n\nUsing the group company, you can compare the performance of your member companies and also keep a tab on the overall business. The consolidated data proves to be useful, especially at the end of the financial year, where you can get a picture of the total income, profit, and so on. When it comes to changing or updating the contact details or any vital information for your group company at any time, you can do so in TallyPrime. If you have created a group company and for some reason, you no longer require the data within the member companies, then you can delete the group company at any point of time.\n\n## [Create Group Company](https://help.tallysolutions.com/knowledgebase/group-company-tally/\\#create-group-company)\n\nLet us assume that you own a textile business in Bangalore (Karnataka) called National Enterprises, which consists of sister concerns in the neighbouring cities of Chennai (Tamil Nadu) and Hyderabad (Telangana). The unit in Bangalore deals in fabrics, while the sister concerns in Chennai and Hyderabad deal in ready-made Western and ethnic clothing, respectively. You can create a group company in TallyPrime by adding your sister concerns.\n\nHowever, before creating a group company, it is recommended that:\n\n- The member companies have the same Base currency symbol and Formal name. You can verify this in the Company Creation/Alteration screen.\n- The member companies have uniform books/charts of accounts. In other words, the corresponding masters/ledgers should have the same names across companies. This will help in proper consolidation of accounts and accuracy of MIS reports. For example, if the sales ledgers are named as Sales in one company and Sale in another company, it might lead to confusion and improper consolidation in the group company.\n\nNow, you can proceed to create your group company.\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](http://youtube.com/watch?v=txFIzHQ8DuU)\n\n1.

Accept the screen. As always, you can press **Ctrl+A** to save.\n\nIn the Gateway of Tally, you can see the group company (in bold) along with the member companies. You can shut the other companies by pressing **Ctrl+F3**, and proceed to use the group company.\n\nNext time you open a company in TallyPrime, the group company will now appear in the **List of Companies**.\n\n[![Select Group Company](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/select-group-company-tally.jpg)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/select-group-company-tally.jpg)\n\n## [View Consolidated Financial Data](https://help.tallysolutions.com/knowledgebase/group-company-tally/\\#view-consolidated-financial-data)\n\nWhen you create a group company, the data of financial reports such as Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss A/c and Trial Balance are consolidated without any impact on the transactions of the member companies. Thus, you can compare the performance of your sister concerns, and effectively measure the overall health of your business. You can also submit this consolidated data to internal and external stakeholders such as company management, investors, auditors, and so on.\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](http://youtube.com/watch?v=NgBMm29dhM8)\n\n1.

Using this consolidated information, you can gain useful business perspectives, such as which of your member companies utilised the funds in the best way, or which company was the most profitable, and so on.\n\n## [Alter Group Company](https://help.tallysolutions.com/knowledgebase/group-company-tally/\\#alter-group-company)\n\nIn TallyPrime, you can easily add or remove a member company, or update the contact details of your group company.

      "learning": "Last updated on: December 17, 2024 \\| ⏱ 12 min read\n\nAuditing stands as a critical function within any business organisation, signifying the assurance of true and fair transactions throughout the fiscal year. TallyPrime incorporates a built-in feature known as Tally Audit, facilitating auditors in conducting audits or monitoring alterations that impact transaction integrity. Such changes, including modifications to dates, ledger masters, and voucher amounts, are accurately captured and reflected within the Tally Audit Listings.\n\nTally Audit refers to the process of examining and verifying financial transactions recorded in TallyPrime. During audits, auditors review the accuracy and completeness of financial data entered into the software, ensuring adherence to accounting standards and regulatory requirements. It helps in identifying errors, discrepancies, or fraudulent activities, thus ensuring the reliability and integrity of financial information presented by the organization. Audits are crucial for maintaining transparency, compliance, and trustworthiness in financial reporting.\n\nWithin TallyPrime, users can access the audit statistics of their company effortlessly. This includes audit listings categorised into voucher types, masters, and users, providing comprehensive insights into the auditing process.\n\n## Enable Tally Audit Features\n\nYou have to enable the Security Controls, **Tally Audit** feature while creating a company. You can use the administrator login ID or create a user with **Tally Audit** access by selecting Audit Listings in respective security levels.\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](https://youtu.be/vWUDOtE__yw)\n\n1. **Gateway of Tally** \\> Press **Alt+K** (Company) > **Alter**.\n2.

In case the auditor/administrator is satisfied with the authenticity of the transactions or the changes made, he will accept all or selective transactions by clicking the relevant button. Once the transactions are accepted, they are removed from the audit listing and will not be displayed again.\n\n## Audit Listing for Voucher Types\n\nDuring audits, you can review the accuracy and completeness of financial data entered into the Voucher Types, ensuring adherence to accounting standards and regulatory requirements.\n\n- **Gateway of Tally > Display More Reports > Statement of Accounts > Tally Audit > Voucher Types**.\n\n[![audit-listing-of-voucher-types](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/audit-listing-of-voucher-types.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/audit-listing-of-voucher-types.png)\n\nThe Audit Statistics screen showing the audit statistics based on Voucher Types is displayed as shown, where the Entered and Altered voucher’s count are displayed in columnar format.\n\nThere are varied configurations in the **F12**(Configure) section of the **Audit Statistics** that allow you to display the voucher types as per your requirements.

      "learning": "Last updated on: December 19, 2025 \\| ⏱ 7 min read\n\n[Release 7.0](https://help.tallysolutions.com/kbtag/release-7-0/)\n\n[List of field names](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/List-of-field-names-1.xlsx) \\| [Find with Conditions](https://help.tallysolutions.com/find-with-conditions/) \\| [Know More About Find](https://help.tallysolutions.com/know-more-about-find/) \\| [FAQ](https://help.tallysolutions.com/find-faq/)\n\n**Find in TallyPrime** makes searching effortless. Just enter any detail like a party name or vehicle number and it instantly locates user-entered information in masters and transactions, all without leaving your screen. It remembers your past queries and displays previously entered keywords as you type, helping you locate information faster. You can turn off history tracking anytime.\n\n**Find delivers precise results:**\n\n- Even when words are slightly varied or misspelled.\n\n- Whether you want to match **all** keywords or **any** of them.\n\n- Across one company or multiple loaded companies.\n\n- When you narrow your search to specific fields.\n\nYou can also restrict users from viewing the **Find – Results** screen for specific companies. When multiple companies are loaded, users can only see results for the ones they have access to. If access to certain voucher types is restricted, users won’t be able to drill down or view Details of Match for those vouchers.\n\nTallyPrime lets you configure the results for your current session or save them for future use from **F1** (Help) > **Settings** \\> **Find**.\n\nHow to Find Details Entered in Transactions and Masters with SmartFind in TallyPrime \\| TallyHelp - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of Tally Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC62ArIQMFhfoIpyFYP5DMSw?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.tallysolutions.com%2F)\n\nTally Solutions\n\n160K subscribers\n\n[How to Find Details Entered in Transactions and Masters with SmartFind in TallyPrime \\| TallyHelp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DyVN1lVy9U)\n\nTally Solutions\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nMore videos\n\n## More videos\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

From any screen, press **Alt+F**.\n\n2. Enter the cheque number and press **Enter**.\n\nIn the **Find – Results** screen, under **Matches Found In**, you can view the field name where the match is found.\n\n[![Matches-Found-In](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Matches-Found-In.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Matches-Found-In.png)\n\n3. Select the transaction and press **Alt+H** (Details of Match). The matched keyword appears in **bold** for an exact match and in _**bold italics**_ when it matches a keyword with similar spelling.\n\n[![Details-of-match](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Details-of-match.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Details-of-match.png)\n\nYou can further drill down from the transaction to view or edit the voucher.\n\n## Include Similar Spellings\n\nBefore creating a ledger, you might want to check if one already exists with a slightly different spelling to avoid creating duplicates. You can do this using the **Include Similar Spellings** option. For text, results that match both exact and similar spellings are displayed. However, for numbers or alphanumeric values, only exact matches are shown.\n\n[![Similar-spelling](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similar-spelling.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similar-spelling.png)\n\nIf you are looking for **Sourav Traders**, by default, **Find** will show only exact matches.\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](https://youtu.be/fxgKwVnVVLU)\n\n- Press **F9**(Include Similar Spellings) to modify the current results.\n\nAlternatively, press **Ctrl+B**(Basis of Values) and enable **Include Similar Spellings**.\n\n[![Similar-spelling](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similar-spelling-1-1.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Similar-spelling-1-1.png)\n\nTo always include similar spellings, go to **F1** (Help) > **Settings** \\> **Find** \\> **Include Similar Spellings** and enable it.\n\n## Include Contains Match\n\nIf you recall only part of a name, be it a party, stock item, or godown, the **Include Contains Match** option helps you find all entries that contain your keyword.\n\n[![Contains-match](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Contains-match.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Contains-match.png)\n\nFor example, if you are looking for **Bhagya Solutions**, then by default, only exact matches will appear.\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](https://youtu.be/lLe_EXj-Zqc)\n\n- Press **Ctrl+B** (Basis of Values) and enable Include Contains Match to modify the current results.\n\n[![Contains-match](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Contains-match1.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Contains-match1.png)\n\nTo always include contains matches, go to **F1** (Help) > **Settings** \\> **Find** \\> **Include Contains Match** and enable it.\n\n## Include All or Any Keywords\n\nWhen you enter multiple keywords, **Find** by default shows results containing all those words. You can configure it once to show results with any of the keywords, and it will continue to do so until you change the setting.\n\n[![All-or-any](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/All-or-any.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/All-or-any.png)\n\nFor example, if you are looking for **Bhagya Solutions**, it will show entries containing both **Bhagya** and **Solutions**. To see results including any words like **Bhagya** or **Solutions**,\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](https://youtu.be/OOOWbXahgo4)\n\n- Press **F1** (Help) > **Settings** \\> **Find** \\> **Show results when**, and select **Any Word is Present** and enter **Bhagya Solutions**.\n\n[![All-or-any1](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/All-or-any1.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/All-or-any1.png)\n\n## Find Across Multiple Loaded Companies\n\nIf you have multiple companies loaded and want to check whether a party exists in one of the companies, you can check that by pressing **F3** (Company).\n\nBy default, **Find** shows results only from the current company.\n\n[![Current-company](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Current-company-3.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Current-company-3.png)\n\nFor example, if you want to see whether **Sourav Traders** exists in all the loaded companies, then\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](https://youtu.be/oO_zNKfiixQ)\n\n- On the **Find – Results** screen, press **F3** (Company) and select **All Companies**.\n\n[![All-loaded-companies](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/All-loaded-companies.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/All-loaded-companies.png)\n\nTo always include results from all loaded companies, press **F1** (Help) > **Settings** \\> **Find** \\> **Find Within** \\> **Loaded Companies**.\n\nTo view the results company-wise, press **F5** (Company-view).\n\n## Find in Specific Fields\n\nIf you want to find keywords entered in a specific field of a transaction or master, you can mention the field name along with its value.\n\n[![destination](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/destination.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/destination.png)\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](https://youtu.be/HTPcm9ZmJAk)\n\nFor example, to see only transactions where the destination is Delhi, type **Destination:Delhi**. This will show only those transactions where the destination field has Delhi.\n\nIf you want to look for multiple keywords within a specific field, type the keywords inside quotes.\n\nFor example: **Ledgername: ‘Bhagya Solutions’** or **Ledgername: “Bhagya Solutions”**. Otherwise, only the first keyword will be applied to the specific field, and the remaining keywords will be looked across all fields.\n\nYou can view the [List of field names](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/List-of-field-names-1.xlsx) here.\n\nAdditionally, you can apply more conditions when searching in specific fields and use operators like **OR** **(\\|)**, **NOT (!)** , **>**, **<**, or **=** to refine your results. To know more, click [here](https://help.tallysolutions.com/find-with-conditions/).\n\n## Maintain History for Find\n\nFind automatically stores the keywords you looked for. When you begin typing, it displays suggestions based on your previously entered keywords. When you press Alt+F, you will see the last five keywords. The other keywords remain saved and appear when you enter similar terms.\n\nIf you do not wish to view the saved history, you can clear the history. And if you prefer not to maintain any history, you can disable the option.\n\nTo disable Maintain History,\n\nPress **F1** (Help) > **Settings** \\> **Find** \\> **Maintain History**.\n\n## Configure Results Display\n\nYou can configure the display of your results by pressing **F12** (Configure).\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Configuration-300x120.png)\n\n- **No. of results to display**: By default, TallyPrime shows top 100 results each under Transactions and Masters. You can change this number anytime.\n- **Show from**: By default, TallyPrime displays results for both masters and transactions. If you want to see results for only one of them, you can select Transactions or Masters.\n\nWhen you choose to view results from Masters or Transactions, you can further refine your view in the Find – Results screen using **F4** (Master Type/Voucher Type).\n\n## Find Details Entered in Another Language\n\nIn Find, you can look for keywords in other languages if your master or transactions are created in that language. However, if you are looking for keyword, along with the field name, then please ensure that the field name is always entered in English.\n\nFor example: **Narration: <keyword can be in any other language>**\n\n## Access Results Based on User Role\n\nIf a user doesn’t have access to the **Find – Results** screen for a company, no results will be displayed for that company when they look for any details.\n\nTo disallow full access to Find – Results screen:\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](https://youtu.be/3r-co4Ofyds)\n\n1. Press **Alt+K** (Company) > **User Roles**.\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Security-control-249x300.png)\n\n2.

Press **Ctrl+A** to save the changes.\n\nA note will appear at the bottom of the screen, indicating that the results are shown based on the user’s access permissions.\n\n[![Access](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Access.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Access.png)\n\nWhen multiple companies are loaded, no results are displayed if printing or previewing is disallowed for any of the companies.\n\nTo know more about restricting or providing access, refer to the [User Management in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/manage-users-in-tallyprime/#user-management-in-tallyprime \"https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/manage-users-in-tallyprime/#user-management-in-tallyprime\").\n\nYou can use the [Sample Data](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sample-Data.zip) to test this feature in TallyPrime, without affecting your company data. The [Read Me](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Read-Me.docx) file has the instructions on using the sample data.\n\n## Questions & Answers\n\n1.

This helps you decide whether to use TallyPrime’s Sample Excel Files or your own Excel structure.\n\n### Option A: Use Your Own Excel Files\n\nUse this if you are already maintaining data in your own Excel format.\n\n1. Map the columns in your Excel with the corresponding fields in TallyPrime [using Mapping Templates](https://help.tallysolutions.com/import-data-in-tally/ \"https://help.tallysolutions.com/import-data-in-tally/\").\n\n2. Import your data without modifying your existing Excel format.\n\nLearn: [**How to Import Data using Any Excel File \\| User-defined Excel Templates**](https://help.tallysolutions.com/import-data-in-tally/ \"https://help.tallysolutions.com/import-data-in-tally/\")\n\n**Advanced Import Scenarios**\n\nIf your Excel sheet is structured differently, you can still import data into TallyPrime by mapping fields appropriately.\n\nLearn how to:\n\n- [**Map Top & Bottom Voucher Entries using Fixed Ledger Columns**](https://help.tallysolutions.com/map-top-and-bottom-voucher-entries/ \"https://help.tallysolutions.com/map-top-and-bottom-voucher-entries/\")\n\nConfigure mapping when debit/credit details appear in separate sections.\n\n- [**Map Data from Multiple Rows & Columns**](https://help.tallysolutions.com/map-data-from-multiple-rows-columns/ \"https://help.tallysolutions.com/map-data-from-multiple-rows-columns/\")\n\nImport data where a single voucher’s details span across multiple rows or multiple columns.\n\n- [**Map Data With & Without Column Headers**](https://help.tallysolutions.com/map-data-with-without-column-headers/ \"https://help.tallysolutions.com/map-data-with-without-column-headers/\")\n\nImport data from Excel file with or without header titles.\n\n- [**Map Nett Amount Values**](https://help.tallysolutions.com/map-nett-amount-values/ \"https://help.tallysolutions.com/map-nett-amount-values/\")\n\nUse net amounts directly when ledger-wise amounts are not available.\n\n- [**Exclude Rows During Import**](https://help.tallysolutions.com/exclude-rows-in-excel/ \"https://help.tallysolutions.com/exclude-rows-in-excel/\")\n\nSkip unwanted Excel rows using mapping rules.\n\n- [**Map Attendance Data from Excel**](https://help.tallysolutions.com/map-attendance-data-from-excel/ \"https://help.tallysolutions.com/map-attendance-data-from-excel/\")\n\nImport attendance records into TallyPrime using structured mapping.\n\n- [**Set Up Unique Values in Mapping Templates**](https://help.tallysolutions.com/how-to-use-mapping-templates-for-importing-data-additional-import-scenarios/ \"https://help.tallysolutions.com/how-to-use-mapping-templates-for-importing-data-additional-import-scenarios/\")\n\nSelect parameters to define uniqueness and create the required masters or transactions.\n\n### Option B: Use Sample Excel Files Provided by TallyPrime\n\nUse this if you want a ready-made Excel structure.\n\n1.

      "learning": "Last updated on: June 20, 2025 \\| ⏱ 16 min read\n\nEvery time there is a purchase or sale of goods, you need to record the same using the Purchase and Sales Voucher. While recording the vouchers you need to mention the rate of the goods, discount if any and so on. In TallyPrime you can manage such buying and selling prices of the goods by specifying the Standard Cost and Standard Price of the goods on a particular date or period. You can also set up a price list for selling goods to a specific type of customer.\n\nBased on each stock item’s buying and selling prices, you may want to maintain the rates so that they automatically appear when you pass a transaction. You can do this in TallyPrime by providing the standard cost (for purchase) and standard price (for sales) for each stock item. You can maintain rates for the stock items daily or for a specific period based on your business needs. When you record the purchase and sales invoices, the standard cost and price automatically appear for that stock item. If you want to fix the selling price based on the type of customers, then you can create Price Levels in TallyPrime and create separate Price Lists for all the Price Levels. For example, you can create a price level for a regular customer or any walk-in customer and set the price list for them. You can also set a discount percentage for each price level.\n\n## [Manage Buying (Purchase) Price Using Standard Cost](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/sales-process/selling-buying-prices-tally/\\#stdcost)\n\nStandard Cost is an estimated cost which is derived from the historical analysis of data.

Due to such customers, you may want to fix the selling price of items at different rates based on the type of customer or your preferences. You can create different price levels and assign different price lists to these price levels.\n\nFor example, you can create Wholesaler, Distributor, and Customer as price levels and assign applicable price lists to these price levels, as per your requirements.

      "title": "Configure VAT Masters in TallyPrime",
      "learning": "Last updated on: May 17, 2024 \\| ⏱ 9 min read\n\nConfiguring VAT masters in TallyPrime is very simple.\n\nTallyPrime facilitates defining VAT details at different levels. This provides the convenience of applying tax rules at the highest level, which is the company level, as well as the flexibility to modify, override or define details at the lower levels\n\n, based on one's business requirement.\n\nFor example, the business is dealing with different types of batteries and if all the items are attracting the same VAT rate, the tax rate can be defined at the company level.\n\nIf the business is dealing with batteries and leather goods, then the tax rates are different, then the tax rate can be defined in the stock group level.\n\nThe user can define the rules at the company level and override at the lower level. The rules can be inherited as follows:\n\n- Company\n- Stock Group\n- Stock Item\n- Ledger Group\n-  Ledger\n- Transaction\n- Transaction Entry\n\n```\nNote: The rules that are defined at the voucher type or voucher type class level will be used as 'template', thereby it will be used ONLY to fill the values in the transaction by default in create mode.\n```\n\n## VAT rates\n\nAfter migrating to release 5.0, you can start recording invoices. If these are transactions that have statutory implications, then the required masters have to be configured. In most scenarios the business can define the tax rules in few minutes and start recording transactions.\n\nChoose  the scenario most suitable for your business and know how VAT details can be configured at different levels.\n\n**Scenario 1: I am dealing with stock items which have the same VAT rate.**\n\nFor a business with all stock items having the same VAT rate, the tax rates can be defined in the company level.

      "learning": "Last updated on: December 9, 2024 \\| ⏱ 29 min read\n\nIn your business, along with the regular sales at different GST rates, you can also supply goods and services at a nil rate or even be exempt. You can supply goods or services to places located in SEZ or Other Territories. The supply can go to the parties who are from an embassy or UN Body. You may provide goods or services for export or as deemed appropriate for export and the high seas.\n\nWhen you provide goods or services with a Nil rate, the goods are taxed at 0%. On the other hand, if you sell goods or services as exempt, then such supplies are wholly exempt from tax under the GST Act. When you supply goods or services to a party located in SEZ, those supplies can be taxable, nil-rated, or exempted and fall under the LUT/Bond.\n\nIn the case of supplies to Other Territories, there can be three scenarios where both you and your customer are in Other Territories, or you are located in State or Union Territory and your customer is in Other Territories and vice versa. You can export your goods or services outside of India, and you can also treat your supply as deemed export if it does not leave India’s borders.\n\nSupply the goods to the customer in the case of High Sea Sales, and allow that customer to sell the same goods to another party after the goods sail from the loading port.\n\nAll these supplies can be recorded in TallyPrime using a Sales Voucher. You need to make changes in the registration type of your party ledger in accordance with the type of sales that you make. Once the party ledger is correctly configured and the voucher has been recorded, the transactions automatically appear in the applicable table of GSTR-1.\n\n## [Nil Rated GST Sales](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/gst-regular-sales/nature-of-transaction/\\#Sales-nil-rate)\n\nWhen you sell goods or services to a local or interstate customer at a nil rate, you do not have to pay GST on such sales. You can record Nil-rated sales in TallyPrime by using a sales voucher. All you need to do is configure the sales ledger with the Taxability Type set to Nil Rated, and the transaction appears in the Nil Rated Invoices table in GSTR-1. A few of the Nil-rated items are grains, salt, cereals, and more.\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](https://youtu.be/zOVdKGewCRc)\n\n1. Configure the taxability type in the sales ledger for Nil Rated.\n\n1. In the sales ledger, select **Taxability Type: Nil Rated**.\n2.

As a user, you do not have to remember such specific details of the party or cross-verify any such details while passing a transaction. All you have to do is simply select, **System Inferred** while selecting the **Nature of Transaction**,and based on the details entered in the transaction, it starts appearing in the applicable section of GSTR-1.\n\nLet us look at a few examples:\n\nIf both the company state and party state are the same, and the party is selected as **Regular** under GST **Registration type**,the nature of the transaction inferred by the system is **Local Sales – Taxable**. Similarly, in the case of a **Regular** party, if the company state and party state are different, the nature of the transaction inferred by the system is **Interstate Sales – Taxable**.\n\n[![System Inferred Party Registration](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/system-inferred-pary-registration-tally-2.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/system-inferred-pary-registration-tally-2.gif)\n\nIn the case of a Deemed Export GST Sale to a party that is registered as **Regular-Deemed Exporter**, the **Nature of Transaction** via **System Inferred** is either **Local Deemed Export – Taxable** or **Interstate Deemed Export – Taxable** based on the location of the party.\n\n[![Deemed Exporter Party Registration](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/deemed-exporter-party-registration.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/deemed-exporter-party-registration.gif)\n\nIn the case of a GST Sale to SEZ where the party type is registered as **Regular-SEZ**, the **Nature of Transaction** via the **System Inferred** is **Sales to SEZ -Taxable**.\n\nSimilarly, if the location of a party is outside of India, then TallyPrime automatically log the transaction under **Exports – Taxable** on selecting **System Inferred**.\n\n**Select Nature of Transaction manually**\n\nIf you want to manually select the Natures of Transaction as per your requirement, you can also do that by selecting the required option from the list. This overrides **System Inferred** details displaying manually selected options.\n\n## [Exempt GST Sales](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/gst-regular-sales/nature-of-transaction/\\#sales-exempt)\n\nExempt yourself from paying GST on the sale of goods or services to a local or interstate customer if they are wholly exempt from tax under the GST Act. You can record exempted sales in TallyPrime by using a sales voucher. All you need to do is configure the sales ledger with the Taxability Type set as Exempt and the transaction appears in the Nil Rated Invoices table in GSTR-1 but under the column of Exempted. A few of the exempted items are bread, fresh fruits, curd, and more.\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](https://youtu.be/1ArVy82lg2g)\n\n1.

You can record SEZ sales in TallyPrime by using a sales voucher. You need to configure the sales ledger with the Taxability Type set as Regular-SEZ. The different types of sales that determine the tax applicability are Taxable SEZ sales, Exempt and nil-rated SEZ sales, and SEZ sales under a LUT/bond. In the case of Taxable SEZ sales, IGST is applicable for both local and interstate parties, no tax is applicable for Exempt and nil-rate SEZ sales or SEZ sales under a LUT/bond. SEZ sales under LUT/bond are allowed when you have signed a letter of undertaking with the department for the sale of goods without the payment of duty.\n\n_In this section_\n\n- [Taxable SEZ sale](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/gst-regular-sales/nature-of-transaction/#taxable-sez)\n- [Exempt and nil-rated SEZ sale](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/gst-regular-sales/nature-of-transaction/#exempt-nil-rated-sez)\n- [SEZ sale under LUT/bond](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/gst-regular-sales/nature-of-transaction/#SEZ-LUT-Bond)\n\n### **[Taxable SEZ sale](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/gst-regular-sales/nature-of-transaction/\\#taxable-sez)**\n\nWhen you sell goods or services to a party located in SEZ, such sales can be taxable depending on the Taxability Type you have selected.

For instance, there is an order for glass-coating 8,000 sq. meters of a pipeline in a power plant project. In such a case, you may require an advance payment from the party to secure the manufacturing and supply cost of the coating material.\n\nSo, in your business, there can be situations in which you will receive advance payments from parties. As per [Section 12 to 14 of the CGST Act, 2017](https://www.cbic.gov.in/resources//htdocs-cbec/gst/51_GST_Flyer_Chapter5.pdf), the time of the supply of services decides the period in which you need to pay GST, and the time of supply is considered as per the voucher date of the advance payment received from the party.\n\nSo, if the purchase order is of INR 10 lakhs issued for the supply of services in the month of Jul-22, and you have an advance receipt of INR 1 lakh in the month of May-22, then you will need to pay GST for:\n\n- INR 1 lakh in the May-22 return period.\n- The rest of the sum (9 lakh), as per the voucher date on which the party gives the rest of the payment.\n\n**Advance receipts for composition dealers**\n\nIt is important to note that as per [notification 66/2017 dated 15.11.2017](https://www.cbic.gov.in/resources//htdocs-cbec/gst/notfctn-66-central-tax-english.pdf), if you have not opted for the composition scheme, then you are not liable to pay GST on the advances received.\n\n**All-new advance receipt experience in TallyPrime Release 3.0**\n\nIn TallyPrime Release 3.0 onwards, you can account for the advances received under GST using the Advance Receipt voucher with automatic computation of the liability on the voucher. Subsequently, the voucher will reflect in the Table 11 of GSTR-1 in TallyPrime with the period and the type of tax to be paid as per the place of supply.\n\n**Flexibility to follow journal voucher approach**\n\nYou can also use Journal vouchers to record advance receipts, if you follow the practice in your business.\n\n**Adjustment of advance received in sales invoice**\n\nIf you have certain unadjusted advance amount, then TallyPrime Release 3.0 and onwards, you have a facility to specify the amount so that you can easily adjust the same in your sales invoices.\n\n**Refund of advance received**\n\nIn case of refunds, you can create a Credit Note and the liability against the advance amount received gets reversed automatically, while you have the flexibility to reverse the liability using a Journal voucher.\n\nIn this topic, you will understand the procedures to account for the GST advances received in TallyPrime, setting off the advances received in a sales invoice, and how to record the refund of an advance received.\n\nHow to Record GST Adv Receipt & Adjust the Amount in Sales Invoice (Hindi) \\| TallyHelp - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of Tally Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC62ArIQMFhfoIpyFYP5DMSw?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.tallysolutions.com%2F)\n\nTally Solutions\n\n160K subscribers\n\n[How to Record GST Adv Receipt & Adjust the Amount in Sales Invoice (Hindi) \\| TallyHelp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRa29B3w7vc)\n\nTally Solutions\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nMore videos\n\n## More videos\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

The setup will enable you to set off GST advances received from parties in sales invoices.\n\nIf you do not want to set off GST advances in sales invoices, then you do not need to set up TallyPrime for it. In that case, you can follow the procedure you followed in TallyPrime Release 2.1 or earlier. To know how to do it, refer to [Account for Advance Receipts Under GST for TallyPrime Release 2.1 or Earlier](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/advance/india-gst-advance-receipts-tally#release-2-1-or-earlier).\n\n1.

This ensures that your GST returns until that period remains unaffected.\n\nFor instance, if you had reported GST liabilities using Journal vouchers until 31-Mar-22, then the **Applicable from** date must be 1-Apr-22 or later than that.\n\nThis ensures that the GST returns of 31-Mar-22 and earlier remain unaffected and the Journal vouchers are retained in the GST returns.\n\nIn this case, if the **Applicable from** date is set 31-Mar-22 or earlier, then TallyPrime starts reporting GST liabilities in the GST Returns based on the Advance Receipts, thereby replacing the Journal vouchers with Advance Receipts.\n\nTo know how to adjust advance amount in sales invoice, refer to the [Adjust GST Advances Received](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/gst-reports/india-gst-advance-receipts-tally/#set-off-advances-in-sales) section.\n\nIf you have multiple GST registrations, then the setting will get implemented for all the GST registrations.\n\n## [Raise Tax Liability for Advances Received](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/advance/india-gst-advance-receipts-tally\\#tax-liability-advance-receipt)\n\nThere may be some advances for which you have recorded the vouchers, but you are yet to raise the tax liability in TallyPrime.\n\nYou can record a Journal voucher to raise the tax liability for such vouchers.\n\n1.

TallyPrime’s 24 pre-defined voucher types for accounting, inventory, payroll, and orders make accounting entry a layman’s job. No matter if you are recording a sales invoice, a payment entry, or a receipt of payment, you can simply open the required voucher type in TallyPrime, select the ledgers and other details, and record the transaction.\n\nTo record several types of transactions in your business like sales, payment, contra, journal, and so on, it becomes imperative to have a sound knowledge of accounting so that your books are error-free. A slight mistake can impact the books and show inaccurate reports that can have grave consequences for your business. TallyPrime with its vouchers takes care of all the etiquette of accounting.\n\nFor example, for cash payments and bank payments, the predefined voucher type is Payment Voucher. Similarly, Sales for recording sales transactions. Furthermore, you can create and have two or more sales voucher types in TallyPrime for different kinds of sales transactions. For example, Credit Sales, Cash Sales, and so on.\n\nIn TallyPrime, you can manage the voucher types as mentioned below:\n\n- Alter a pre-defined voucher type as per your business need.\n- Create new voucher types as per your business need.\n- Activate/Deactivate voucher type as per your business need.\n- Use common narration or narration for each ledger selected in the voucher.\n- Enable the option to print immediately after saving the vouchers.\n- Delete unused voucher type created by you.\n\nAll these options around voucher types in TallyPrime make data entry a simple task that can be accomplished by anyone and not necessarily an accounting professional.\n\n## [View and Alter the Voucher Types](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/voucher-types-tally/\\#view-alter-voucher-types)\n\nJust like any other master in TallyPrime, you can also view and edit the pre-defined voucher types on the go.

However, it is a better accounting practice to provision for such transactions. When the transaction actually happens, you can regularise the optional voucher.\n\nMemorandum voucher and Reversing Journal voucher are optional by default.\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](https://youtu.be/WVbHBUHg0_g)\n\nIn the Voucher Type Creation/Alteration screen,\n\n1.

As always, you can press **Ctrl** + **A** to save.\n\nThis way you can simply highlight any specification in a voucher or a ledger used in a voucher.\n\nWhile recording transactions,\n\n- If you are in Accounting Invoice or Item Invoice mode, select the ledger, press **Ctrl+I (More Details)** > **Ledger Narration** \\> enter the **Narration**.\n\n- If you are in As Voucher mode, select the required ledger, provide the amount, enter the narration in the Narration field appearing below the ledger name.\n\n- Ledger narration entered in any mode during voucher creation will be only visible in As Voucher mode.\n\n[![Narration in Voucher in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/narration-each-ledger-tally-300x154.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/narration-each-ledger-tally.png)\n\n### [Configure accounting allocation](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/voucher-types-tally/\\#accounting-allocation)\n\nYou might have recurring expenses or income that need to be allocated to specific accounts each time they occur. Instead of manually entering the account details for each transaction, you can set up default accounting allocations so that TallyPrime automatically assigns the transactions to the appropriate accounts based on predefined rules.\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](https://youtu.be/9mk-_-gzGX8)\n\nIn the Voucher Type Creation/Alteration screen,\n\n1.

Set the option **Set/Alter Default Accounting Entries** to **Yes**.\n\n**Default Accounting Screen** appears, as shown below:\n\n[![Default Accounting Entries in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/default-accounting-allocation-300x229.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/default-accounting-allocation.png)\n3. Complete the remaining configurations as needed.\n4. Accept the screen. As always, you can press **Ctrl** + **A** to save.\n\nOnce enabled, you can simply allocate the required ledgers to the specified accounts automatically.\n\n### WhatsApp invoices immediately after saving\n\nDepending on your transactions or parties, there might come up a requirement where you will need to share your invoices immediately. You can configure the respective voucher type in TallyPrime and the next time you record the invoice and save it, TallyPrime will open the WhatsApp details screen instantly to help you [send the invoice to the selected party](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tallyprime-with-whatsapp/share-documents-using-whatsapp-for-business/#whatsapp-invoices-after-saving).\n\n## [Delete Voucher Types](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/voucher-types-tally/\\#delete-voucher-types)\n\nYou may want to delete Voucher Types in TallyPrime that you have created. Such a need occurs in the following scenarios:\n\n1. You had created a Voucher Type long ago, and you haven’t used it.\n2. You had created a Voucher Type, which is similar to an already existing Voucher Type.\n3. The Voucher Type was created by mistake.\n4. You have created a new Company, which is a copy of an existing Company.\n\nHowever, some of the Voucher Types are not required in the new Company.\n\nAlthough deleting a Voucher Type is very simple in TallyPrime, you can only delete it if the following pre-requisites are met.\n\n1. The Voucher Type is not a default one such as Sales, Purchase, and among the 24 pre-defined voucher types provided in TallyPrime.\n2. In the Company data, there is no voucher recorded using that Voucher Type.\n\nYou may want to delete a Voucher Type, even if you have recorded transactions using it. In such a case, you will need to delete all the transactions recorded using that specific Voucher Type. You can also move those transactions to a different voucher type to avoid loss of data and compliance issues, and delete the voucher type.\n\n_In this section_\n\n- [_Delete transactions recorded using a Voucher Type_](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/voucher-types-tally/#delete-transactions-recorded-using-a-voucher-type)\n- [_Delete a Voucher Type_](https://help.tallysolutions.com/knowledgebase/voucher-types-tally/#delete-voucher-type)\n\n### [Delete transactions recorded using a Voucher Type](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/voucher-types-tally/\\#delete-transactions-recorded-using-a-voucher-type)\n\nBefore deleting transactions, you should [take a Company data backup](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime-server/data-management-tallyprime-server/backup-of-data-in-tallyprime-server/) so that you can restore those transactions by restoring the Company data in the future, if needed.\n\nYou can delete the transactions by drilling down on the **Statistics** report in TallyPrime.\n\nFollow the path given below.\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](https://youtu.be/v_OsVzTjg7k)\n\n1.

Drilldown to the transactions.\n\n1. Drilldown on the required Voucher Type.\n\n      The **Voucher Monthly Register** screen appears.\n2. Drilldown on the months in which the transactions were recorded.\n\n      The **Voucher Register** screen appears where all the transactions for the month are listed.\n3. Select all the transactions using Spacebar and press **Alt+D**.\n\n      [![Voucher Register in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/voucher-register-tally-300x155.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/voucher-register-tally.png)\n\nSimilarly, you can delete vouchers recorded using the Voucher Types in other months.\n\n### [Delete a Voucher Type](https://help.tallysolutions.com/knowledgebase/voucher-types-tally/\\#delete-voucher-type)\n\nNow that you have ensured that there are no transactions recorded using the Voucher Type, you can go ahead and delete the Voucher Type.\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](https://youtu.be/mzRwrLcSfG4)\n\n1. Press **Alt** + **G**(Go To) > **Voucher Type** \\> type or select the Voucher Type and press **Enter**.\n\nAlternatively, **Gateway of Tally** > **Alter** > **Voucher Type** \\> type or select the Voucher Type and press **Enter**.\n2. Press **Alt** + **D** todelete and then press **Y** to accept.\n\n## [Voucher Class](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/voucher-types-tally/\\#voucher-class)\n\nVoucher Class in TallyPrime helps you to automate entries during voucher creation. You can pre-define fields that you wish to include and automate in a voucher by using a voucher class. It helps apply specific rules or settings to different types of transactions. You might use a voucher class to handle different tax rates, a particular inventory, or a particular customer and tailor the voucher type accordingly by using a voucher class. For example, you can define a specific tax rate for a particular voucher class created. Let us say, you have created a ‘Sales BLR’ voucher type and in it, you have defined a voucher class ‘iPhone SalesBLR ‘with a fixed GST tax rate of 12%. Now, whenever you pass transactions using this voucher class, the tax rate entry will be automated.\n\nLet us see another detailed example of a stock journal voucher class.\n\nStock Journal voucher classes allow you to handle transfers from one location to another, for companies having multi-location inventory and at least two locations. Once the class is selected, you will need to specify the destination and provide the list of items to be transferred. Through this class, all items/batches will be exactly mirrored as configured in the voucher class to the destination, including **Batch Number**, **Rate,** and **Value**. This will help in faster data entry of the regular type of Stock Journal entries.\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](https://youtu.be/Sy-ZswDnwLU)\n\n1. Press **Alt** + **G** (Go To) > **Alter Master** \\> type or select **Voucher Types** \\> type or select **Stock Journal**.\n\nAlternatively, **Gateway of Tally** > **Alter** \\> type or select **Voucher Types** \\> type or select **Stock Journal**.\n2. **Name of Class**: enter a suitable name, as per the purpose of the voucher class; for example, Transfer.\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/voucher-type-alteration-tally.gif)\n\nThe **Class: Transfer** screen is displayed.\n3. **Use Class for Inter- Godown Transfers**: **Yes**.\n\n[![Providing Name for Voucher Class and Selecting the Options](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/voucher-type-class-inter-godown-transfer-tally.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/voucher-type-class-inter-godown-transfer-tally.gif)\n4. As always, you can press **Ctrl** + **A** to save.\n\nOnce you have created a voucher class now with inter-godown transfer enabled, all you have to do is just enter the destination godown while recording the stock journal voucher and enter the item details.\n\n[![Stock Journal Voucher Class in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stock-journal-voucher-class-tally-1-300x155.jpg)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stock-journal-voucher-class-tally-1.jpg)\n\nSimilarly, you can configure the voucher classes with values as required and simplify and automate your voucher entries.\n\n## [Voucher Type Security](https://help.tallysolutions.com/knowledgebase/voucher-types-tally/\\#voucher-type-security)\n\nVoucher type security in TallyPrime helps you as a business owner to specify and control restrictions on both individual voucher types (Contra, Payment, etc.), and department and group levels (Sales Department, Procurement Department, Accounting Voucher, Inventory Voucher, and so on) for different users. The types of control that can be set include being able to create, alter, print, or have full access to any particular type of voucher. With the voucher type security feature, the administrator can:\n\n- Create a department and role-based segregation of access for different users. For example, allow access based on sales, purchase, accounts, payroll, and so on for employees in those areas of work.\n- Provide or deny access to the level of activity that can be performed on a voucher by different users. For example, allow Ramesh and Suresh to create and alter a payment voucher, and allow Rahul to only view the same.\n- Provide access to an entire group of vouchers like accounting vouchers, or inventory vouchers as a whole.\n\n_In this section_\n\n- [Security for pre-defined groups of vouchers](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/voucher-types-tally/#security-pre-defined-vch-type)\n- [Set up voucher type security for users](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/voucher-types-tally/#set-up-vch-type-security)\n- [Voucher type security add-ons and voucher type security](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting/voucher-types-tally/#vch-type-add-on)\n\n### [Security for pre-defined groups of vouchers](https://help.tallysolutions.com/knowledgebase/voucher-types-tally/\\#security-pre-defined-vch-type)\n\nYou can configure voucher security levels for four pre-defined groups of vouchers.\n\n- Accounting Vouchers: Contra, Payment, and Receipt voucher types.\n- Inventory Vouchers: Rejections In, Rejections Out, Stock Journal, Delivery Note, Receipt Note, Physical Stock, Material In, and Material Out voucher types.\n- Order Vouchers: Sales Order, Purchase Order, Job Work Out Order, and Job Work In Order voucher types.\n- Payroll Vouchers: Payroll and Attendance voucher types.\n\nIf users are allowed/disallowed access for any of the groups listed above, the voucher types listed under the respective group will also carry the same access configuration. Disallowing access to Voucher Types will not affect the user’s access to Create Voucher Types. To restrict a user from creating voucher types, you need to disallow access to Masters.\n\nAs per the example given in the previous section, as Arun has been disallowed access to Payment Voucher, he cannot record transactions in Payment Vouchers. But he can create a voucher type under the Payment voucher type. To restrict Arun’s access for creating voucher types under Payment voucher type, access to Accounting Masters has to be disallowed.\n\n### [Set up voucher type security for users](https://help.tallysolutions.com/knowledgebase/voucher-types-tally/\\#set-up-vch-type-security)\n\nConsider the example of ABC Company having a user named Arun, who records sales and receipt transactions. You need to provide him with access to create and alter sales and receipt vouchers. On the Security Levels screen, you can allow access only to create and alter the sales and receipts vouchers and keep the remaining under the disallow columns.\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](https://youtu.be/ZtN_7zh44MY)\n\n1. **Gateway of Tally** > **Alt+K** (Company) > select **User Roles**.\n2. In **Security Levels** screen, disallow the voucher types and group of vouchers to which you do not want to give access under **Disllow the following Facilities**.\n\nUnder **Allow the following Facilities**, you can give access to create/alter the sales and receipts vouchers, as required in this case.\n\nThe aliases provided for voucher types will not be displayed in the List of Reports while defining the Voucher Type Security.\n\n3. To provide access to **Create/Alter** sales and receipt voucher types, configure the Security Level as shown below:\n\n[![Security Level in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/security-levels-tallyprime-new-300x290.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/security-levels-tallyprime-new.png)\n\nOnce you have set the voucher type security, you can log in using the user’s credentials.\n\nYou can verify the security assigned by logging in as a user with data entry-level security.\n\n- Enter Arun’s login details to open the Company.\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/company-login-screen-tally.gif)\n\nOn navigating to voucher creation screen, you can observe that only receipt and sales vouchers will be enabled for recording transactions.\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/receipt-voucher-with-security-restriction-screen-tally.gif)\n\nIf the user Arun navigates to Day Book, all the vouchers recorded during the period specified will be displayed, but access to Alter/Print the vouchers will be restricted. If the user selects any voucher other than receipt or sales vouchers, an Error Message appears.\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/day-book-screen-tally.gif)\n\n### [Voucher type security add-ons and voucher type security](https://help.tallysolutions.com/knowledgebase/voucher-types-tally/\\#vch-type-add-on)\n\nIf an Add-on for providing Voucher Type Security is already in use:\n\n- Access configurations defined using TallyPrime and the Add-on will be combined. For example, if full access to Sales voucher is disallowed for Arun, and in the Add-on full access to Receipt voucher is disallowed, Arun will not be able to access both Sales and Receipt vouchers.\n- The Voucher Type Security configuration will override the Add-on’s configuration. For example, if full access to the group Accounting Vouchers is disallowed for Arun, and in the Add-on full access to Sales voucher is allowed, Arun will not be able to access the Sales voucher.\n\n### Related Topics\n\n- [How to Use Voucher Numbering Methods \\| TallyHelp](https://help.tallysolutions.com/use-voucher-numbering-methods/)\n- [Company Setup & Security](https://help.tallysolutions.com/security-sharing-videos/)\n- [Taxability Type is invalid or not specified \\| TallyHelp](https://help.tallysolutions.com/taxability-type-is-invalid-or-not-specified-tallyhelp/)\n- [Incorrect Registration Type or Tax Ledger is selected in the Bank transaction \\| TallyHelp](https://help.tallysolutions.com/incorrect-registration-type-or-tax-ledger-is-selected-in-the-bank-transaction/)\n- [Taxability Type is invalid or not specified](https://help.tallysolutions.com/taxability-type-is-invalid-or-not-specified/)\n\n[_𝕏_](https://twitter.com/home?status=https://help.tallysolutions.com/voucher-types-tally/) [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://help.tallysolutions.com/voucher-types-tally/ \"facebook\")\n\n![TallyHelpwhatsAppbanner](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Have-another-Query-Desktop-version.jpg)![TallyHelpwhatsAppbanner](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Have-another-Query-Mobile-version.jpg)\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/close-1.png)\n\nIs this information useful?\n\nYesNo\n\nOn this page\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Helpful_icon.png)Helpful?\n\nDidn't find what you are looking for?

      "title": "Cost Centre or Profit Centre Allocation",
      "learning": "Last updated on: November 3, 2025 \\| ⏱ 21 min read\n\nIn any business, the Cost Centre or Profit Centre plays an important role in tracking the expenses incurred and profit earned by each department. You can create Cost or Profit Centres and allocate expenses and incomes to them. Along with Cost Centres, you can create a Cost Category and use them in Cost Centres for parallel allocation. You can view the same expense allocation between the Cost Centres of two Cost Categories through parallel allocation. For example, with parallel allocation, you can view the allocation of Travel expenses incurred by an Employee and for any Sales schemes. You can also create a Cost Centre Class with the Cost Category and Cost Centres along with the predefined percentage allocation. While recording the transaction, once you select the Cost Centre Class, automatically the expenses and incomes get allocated to the respective Cost Centres based on the percentage of allocation defined.\n\nIn any organisation, it is crucial to keep track of expenses incurred and the profit earned by each department. This helps you to understand which department is incurring more expenses or which department has generated profit. These details help you to decide the action to be taken at the right time. TallyPrime makes it easy for you to track the expenses and profits made by your company. You can maintain your incomes and expenses, as per different business units, employees, projects, departments, and so on, using the Cost Centre capability in TallyPrime.\n\nYou can have multiple Cost Centres or Profit Centres in your company, as needed, and allocate the breakup of incomes and expenses to different Cost Centres or Profit Centres. Such Cost Centres can be created in a hierarchical structure to get a consolidated view of the allocation. For example, you can create Cost Centres like Sales Department, Marketing Department and so on. Further, you can create Cost Centres with employee names under projects where employees from different departments work or the same employee works on different projects. While viewing the report you can view the hierarchy of the Cost Centres under the Cost Category. You can also allocate the same income or expense to different sets of Cost Centres in parallel, say employee-wise as well as project-wise, for reporting purposes by using Cost Categories for the respective Cost Centres.\n\nIn the following diagram, you can see how an organisation uses Cost Centres to track their expenses and incomes. Each employee is represented by a Cost Centre. For each department separate Cost Centres are created to consolidate the expenses incurred and incomes created by all employees in the department.\n\n[![Cost Centre hierarchy](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Cost-Centre-hierrachy.jpeg)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Cost-Centre-hierrachy.jpeg)\n\nIn TallyPrime, you can view the reports that help you to track income and expenses that are incurred Cost Centre-wise. In case you do not want to use Cost Centres, you can disable them as well. To disable the Cost Centres, you need to delete them. In case expenses are allocated to Cost Centres, then those allocations need to be moved to other Cost Centres before deleting the Cost Centres. You can also delete a Cost Category if no Cost Centre or Profit Centre has been grouped under it.\n\n## [Use Cost Centres or Profit Centres for Allocation of Incomes and Expenses](https://help.tallysolutions.com/knowledgebase/cost-centre-allocation-tally/\\#use-cost-centres-allocation-incomes-expenses)\n\nIf you have incomes and expenses, such as commission, interest received, staff welfare, employees, payment recovery, conveyance, and so on, and want to maintain them as per business unit, employee, project, department, and so on, you can use the Cost Centre (also known as Profit Centre) capability in TallyPrime. This enables you to allocate incomes and expenses to Profit Centres or Cost Centres in your business.\n\nHow to Manage Cost Centres in TallyPrime \\| Tally Learning Hub - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of Tally Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC62ArIQMFhfoIpyFYP5DMSw?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.tallysolutions.com%2F)\n\nTally Solutions\n\n160K subscribers\n\n[How to Manage Cost Centres in TallyPrime \\| Tally Learning Hub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SDKZKxOV6o)\n\nTally Solutions\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nMore videos\n\n## More videos\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

Suppose, you have multiple departments and you want to know the expenses incurred or revenue generated by the employees under the departments. You can track such expenses and incomes by creating Cost Centres of the employees.\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](https://youtu.be/SXV7TcszSCU)\n\n1.

      "title": "Manage Your Stock Items",
      "learning": "Last updated on: December 1, 2025 \\| ⏱ 30 min read\n\nDoes your business involve stock items or inventory in the day-to-day transactions? If so, you certainly need to manage and keep track of all your stocks – how much of them have been sold every day, what is the balance stock, are the stocks moving as per the demand, do you have too much unused stock and so on. In TallyPrime, you can create as many stock items as you have in the business, specify units of measurements (UoMs) for each stock item and define tax rates, without having to enter these details again during transactions.\n\nWhether you keep your stocks in different groups, batches or godowns, based on your business practices, you can find the details of your stock  items any way you need. Real-time view of your stock quantity helps to refill your stock in advance to avoid the risk of losing customers, You can also view stock item reports for each group or batch as needed.\n\nCreate & use stock items: Like other masters in TallyPrime, such as ledgers, godowns, stock groups, and so on, you can create stock items by providing a few details. Just enter the name of the stock item and you are done! You can set up details such as Unit of Measurement (UoM) and tax rates any time later. You can also define quantity, rate, and value as the opening balance of your stock.\n\nOnce you create a stock item and use it in your transactions, reports in TallyPrime start tracking the stock item – sales or purchase transactions that include that stock item, number of stock items sold from period to period, overall stock position of your business, and so on.\n\nGroup your stock items: Having a stock group is not mandatory to create a stock item in TallyPrime. If you have been maintaining your stock items without creating any Stock Group, TallyPrime considers all stock items under an internal group called Primary.\n\nHowever, if you keep your stock items in different groups depending on any of their common features such as brand, product type, or size, use the Stock Group feature in TallyPrime. For example, stock items made of the same fabric – say synthetic – can be under one stock group and stock items with cotton fabric can be in a different group. This will not only help to organise the stock items but also provide a consolidated view of the stock items with you.\n\nIn certain cases, stock items from different groups also have a common property and therefore can be categorised across multiple stock groups, using Stock Categories.\n\nFor example, stock items made of synthetic fabric are sold at two different prices – TypeA\\_Ctt at Rs. 500 and TypeB\\_Ctt at Rs. 900. Similarly, synthetic stock items are sold as Type1\\_Syn for Rs. 900 and Type2\\_Syn for Rs. 500. In such cases, keeping the stock group as is, you can create stock category in TallyPrime to see the pricing wise grouping of stock items at the same time.\n\nThe items are classified into Cotton and Synthetic stock groups; at the same time, they are also classified as Items at Rs. 500 and Items at Rs. 900 – the stock categories in this case. Therefore, stock items TypeA\\_Ctt’ and ‘Type1\\_Syn’ (which are part of different stock groups) are viewed as part of the stock category – that is ‘Items @ Rs. 500’. This also helps you get an insight of how many stock items of a particular price is available or sold at a given time.\n\nKnow stock position of your business: Reports in TallyPrime can provide you details of your stock items in different ways. You can view stock position of your business based on the stock item groups and categories. Like any other reports in TallyPrime, stock item details can further be viewed for different periods, such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly, You can configure your reports to view stock items to each party your business deals with. Knowing the overall stock position of your business helps you to decide if you need to fill in the stock items, if items are moving fast or under a particular period or group and so on.\n\n## Stock Items\n\nA stock item in TallyPrime is required to fill in information about the stock or inventory that your business deals with. Once you have created stock item, you can records your business transactions and keep track of the stock item details. Simply enter the name of the stock item you want to create and save it. Also, provide the opening balance details such as quantity, rate, value applicable tax rates so that you can record transactions in less time, without the need to enter all of these details each time in the transactions.\n\nIn TallyPrime Edit Log Release 2.1 and TallyPrime Release 2.1 onwards, you also have a facility to track the history of various activities such as creation, alteration, and deletion that affect Stock items. However, you cannot simply delete a stock item that is already used in any transaction or in some other cases like a BOM (Bill of Materials) entry. You will need to first delete all the vouchers and references of the stock item from all such cases before deleting that stock item.\n\n_In this section_\n\n- [Create stock items](https://help.tallysolutions.com/manage-stock-item-tally/#createstockitem)\n- [Delete stock items](https://help.tallysolutions.com/manage-stock-item-tally/#delete-stock-item)\n- [Create Units for Stock Items](https://help.tallysolutions.com/manage-stock-item-tally/#create-units-for-stock-items)\n- [Alter Units for Stock Items](https://help.tallysolutions.com/manage-stock-item-tally/#alter-units)\n- [Tax rate of stock items](https://help.tallysolutions.com/manage-stock-item-tally/#tax-rate-stock-item)\n- [Stock items in transactions](https://help.tallysolutions.com/manage-stock-item-tally/#stock-item-transaction)\n- [Opening Stock and Closing Stock values](https://help.tallysolutions.com/manage-stock-item-tally/#openingclosingbalance)\n\n### [Create Stock Items](https://help.tallysolutions.com/knowledgebase/manage-stock-item-tally/\\#createstockitem)\n\n1. Gateway of Tally \\> Create \\> type or select Stock Item \\> and press Enter.\n\nAlternatively, press Alt+G (Go To) > Create Master \\> type or select Stock Item \\> and press Enter.\n2. Name & alias: As in other masters, you can specify multiple aliases for the stock item.\n\nTo learn more about language aliases and printing invoices with an alias name, refer to [Print Invoices with or Without Tax in Arabic or Bilingual](https://help.tallysolutions.com/bilingual-invoice-printing/).\n3. Under: Select Primary or an existing Stock Group. If you have not created any Stock Group, you can create one in TallyPrime to assign to the stock item.\n\nAs always, press Alt+C, to create a master on the fly. Alternatively, press **Alt** + **G** (Go To) > **Create Master** \\> type or select **Stock Items** \\> press **Enter**.\n4. **Units**: Select the unit of measurement applicable for the stock item. If the unit is not listed, you can create the unit of measurement in TallyPrime to assign to the stock item.\n\nAs always, press Alt+C, to create a master on the fly. Alternatively, press **Alt** + **G** (Go To) > **Create Master** \\> type or select **Units** \\> press **Enter**.\n\n   - All the UQCs declared by the government or GSTN are available in TallyPrime by default. You can select based on relevance to the product or commodity. Whenever there is a new UQC declared by GSTN that TallyPrime has not provided, or you are yet to upgrade, you can create a new UQC with the exact name and symbol as defined by GSTN. Altering the defined name or UQC is not possible. However, you can create a new UQC.\n\n     1. **Unit Creation** \\> **Unit Quantity Code (UQC)** \\> select **New UQC**.\n     2. Enter the **UQC Name**, and press **Enter**.\n   - For every item in TallyPrime you can associate one or more units of measurement. There are no default Units available. You can create a Simple Unit, or a Compound Unit as needed for each item. You can also use Alternate units, if needed.\n\n     We will help you understand in which scenario you will choose Simple Unit, Compound Unit, or Alternate Units under what conditions.\n\n     **Simple Unit**: A Simple unit consists of a single unit. For example, Meters (m), Kilogram (Kg), Numbers (Nos), and so on. You can use the Simple unit when you are dealing with an item that does not need more than one unit or where only one unit is needed for buying or selling.\n\n     **Compound Unit**: A Compound unit is a combination of two Simple units. You can use a Compound unit when you are dealing with an item that requires more than one unit or when your buying and selling units are different for that item. For a constant unit of measurement, Compound units are used. For example, a Kg (Kilograms) of 1000 Gm (Grams), a Doz (Dozens) of 12 Nos (Numbers), and so on.\n\n     **Alternate Unit**: The Alternate unit is determined by the base unit, whether it is a Simple unit or a Compound unit. You can use an Alternate unit when there are multiple units used by the item and their conversion is flexible or dynamic during the transaction.\n\n     For example, if you are a business owner who purchases Rice bags, where the conventional conversion is that 1 Bag equals 50 Kg, but sometimes 1 Bag may not always calculate 50 Kg. It may sometimes weigh 49 Kg or 49.5 Kg. Since the unit conversion is not constant or is dynamic, we recommend you to use the Alternate unit. Alternative units give you the ability to easily adjust your unit of measurement based on the conversion you are dealing with, in real time, throughout a transaction.\n5. **Statutory Details**: Set the applicable Taxability option for the stock item under Statutory details, The option will depend on the option enabled in the F11 (Features) screen. [Click here to see more](https://help.tallysolutions.com/manage-stock-item-tally/#tax-rate-stock-item).\n6. **Opening Balance**: Specify the opening balance for the Stock Item as on the date of Beginning of Books.\n\n1. Quantity: Specify the stock item Quantity.\n2. Rate: Specify the stock item Rate.\n3. Value: TallyPrime automatically calculates the value by multiplying the Quantity and Rate. You can also edit the value, TallyPrime automatically refreshes the Rate field accordingly.\n7. Accept the screen.

There can also be a situation where a stock item was accidentally created. In TallyPrime, you can delete such stock items from your Company Data. However, there are certain situations where deleting a stock item will have the following dependencies.\n\n- You cannot delete a stock item that is already used in a voucher. Therefore, you will need to first delete all the vouchers related to the stock item and then delete that stock item.\n- You cannot delete a stock item that is referenced in any voucher class, configurations, or other masters. You will need to remove the references of the stock item from all such cases, before deleting that stock item.\n\nOtherwise, you can delete a stock item from the Stock Item Alteration screen itself.\n\n1. Press **Alt** + **G** (Go To) > **Alter Master** \\> type or select **Stock Item** and press **Enter**.\n\nAlternatively, **Gateway of Tally** > **Alter** \\> type or select **Stock Item** and press **Enter**.\n2. Select the stock item from the **List of Stock Items**.\n\nThe **Stock Item Alteration** screen appears.\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stcok-item-delete.gif)\n3. Press **Alt** + **D** to delete the stock item.\n\n### [Create Units for Stock Items](https://help.tallysolutions.com/knowledgebase/manage-stock-item-tally/\\#create-units-for-stock-items)\n\nDepending on your business, you may be selling or buying stock items in different units. For example, you can use simple units like Meters, Centimeters, or Nos. If you sell items in bags and boxes of standard sizes – say 100 kg for a box, using TallyPrime, you can create all different units as per your needs.\n\n#### **[Simple Unit](https://help.tallysolutions.com/manage-stock-item-tally/\\#simple-unit)**\n\n1. While [creating](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/inventory/manage-stock-item-tally/#createstockitem) a stock item, press **Alt+C**, to create a unit master on the fly.\n\nThe **Unit Creation (Secondary)** screen opens.\n2. Enter the details in the **Unit Creation** screen.\n\n1. Enter the **Symbol**. By default, the **Type** field will be selected as **Simple**.\n2. Enter the **Formal name** for the simple unit.\n3. Select the **Unit Quantity Code (UQC)** relevant to the stock item from the list provided.\n\n      The list consists of the number of Unit Quantity Codes (UQC) available for your product or commodity as declared by the Government or GSTN.\n4. Specify the **Number of decimal places** required based on your business needs.\n\n      [![The Simple Unit Creation Screen with Number of Decimal Places Entered as 2 in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/simple-unit.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/simple-unit.gif)\n\n      ```\n      Note: Depending on the business requirement, you can choose the number of decimal places to use in the unit of measurement. For example, if you are in the business of selling Sugar in Kilograms, then you might receive an order for 0.5Kg of Sugar or 0.25Kg of Sugar, so you would enter a decimal place for the unit, depending on what the customer wishes to buy.\n\n      You must therefore enter one decimal place in the unit of measurement for 0.5Kg of Sugar or two decimal places for 0.25Kg of Sugar to avoid any confusion during the transaction.\n      You can enter a maximum of four decimal places for a unit. If your calculations exceed four decimal places, during transaction recording, TallyPrime will perform Normal Rounding of the value to the nearest whole number. This ensures that the stock item calculation remains easy to use. Once you have entered a decimal value for the unit, and the transaction has been recorded with that value, you cannot change it unless you delete the transaction.\n\n      If you try to alter the decimal places, you will receive an error message saying that the number of decimal places for the unit cannot be decreased.\n      ```\n3. Press **Y** to accept the screen. As always, you can press **Ctrl+A** to create a Simple unit.\n\nIn a similar way you can create other Simple Units.

For example, Kg.\n3. Enter the **Conversion** For example, 1000.\n\n      **Note**: Compound units can be created up to any level. For example, milligram < gram < kilogram < quintal < tonne. However, the relationship between the units should be convertible.\n4. Enter the **Second unit**. For example, Gm.\n\n      [![The Compound Unit Creation Screen](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/compound-unit.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/compound-unit.gif)\n3. Press **Y** to accept the screen. As always, you can press **Ctrl+A** to create a Compound unit.\n\n#### **Alternative Units**\n\nTo use Alternate units in a transaction, ensure they are enabled on the Stock Item master.\n\n1.

Enter other relevant details in the **Stock Item Creation** screen, as applicable.\n3. Press **Y** to accept the screen. As always, you can press **Ctrl+A** to save the master.\n\n##### **Use of Alternate Units in a Transaction**\n\nAlternative units are provided in TallyPrime to handle the user-defined units which may not have a constant conversion.\n\nA transaction can be recorded using alternative units to define a conversion during the item allocation, so that a calculation for a stock item in any unit will always be accurate, regardless of whether it is expressed as numbers, dozens, or box.\n\n[![The Alternate Units Used for Conversion when Allocating Stock Items](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stock-item-allocation.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stock-item-allocation.gif)\n\nFor example, when you are recording a transaction with a:\n\n1. stock item calculated in dozen.\n\n[![Conversion of Alternative Units in Dozens (Doz) when Allocating Stock Items](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stock-item-in-dozen.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stock-item-in-dozen.gif)\n2. stock item calculated in a box.\n\n[![Conversion of Alternative Units in Box when Allocating Stock Items](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stock-item-in-box.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stock-item-in-box.gif)\n3. stock item calculated in numbers.\n\n[![Conversion of Alternative Units in Numbers (Nos) when Allocating Stock Items](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stock-item-in-numbers.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stock-item-in-numbers.gif)\n\nConsequently, Alternative units have the flexibility of defining user-defined units that are dynamic, which ensures that the calculation of the stock item will always come out accurate irrespective of the unit.\n\n### [Alter Units for Stock Items](https://help.tallysolutions.com/manage-stock-item-tally/\\#alter-units)\n\nAfter creating a simple unit or compound unit in TallyPrime, you can alter it, as and when needed.\n\n### [Simple Unit](https://help.tallysolutions.com/manage-stock-item-tally/\\#alter-simple-unit)\n\n1.

Press **Ctrl+A** to save.\n\n### [Tax rate of stock items](https://help.tallysolutions.com/knowledgebase/manage-stock-item-tally/\\#tax-rate-stock-item)\n\nStock items attract different tax rates as per the department. Business dealing with stock items need to consider the applicable tax rates in their transactions. To do so, you can set up the tax rate details for the stock items in TallyPrime. The details your enter for the stock items will be automatically considered for calculation in your transactions.\n\nWhen creating or altering the stock item master\n\n1.

In this case, you can use the Godowns/Locations capability of TallyPrime. Using godowns will help you keep a record of inventory moving from one project or manufacturing stage to another. Similarly, you can also track the stock moving in and out of your business premises for consignment sales or job work. You can view stock reports for each godown and account for the movement of stock between godowns.\n\nHow to Create and Manage Multiple Godowns in TallyPrime \\| Tally Learning Hub - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of Tally Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC62ArIQMFhfoIpyFYP5DMSw?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.tallysolutions.com%2F)\n\nTally Solutions\n\n160K subscribers\n\n[How to Create and Manage Multiple Godowns in TallyPrime \\| Tally Learning Hub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6ZxZLVeNGQ)\n\nTally Solutions\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nMore videos\n\n## More videos\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

You can use Godowns/Locations to create a hierarchy for shelves, bins, and even different sections of a warehouse. TallyPrime helps you to see the details of the materials at the top level as well as at each individual level, in a hierarchy of godowns.\n\nFor example, you can simply create Warehouse A, Warehouse B, and Warehouse C, or you can create Southern Region, with Warehouse A and Warehouse B under it, and Eastern Region, with Warehouse C and Warehouse D under it. Then, you can get the total inventory in Southern Region, and the inventory in Warehouse B.\n\nUse multiple godowns: After creating godowns, you are prompted to choose one or more godowns for every movement of inventory. You can put all your stock into a single godown or use multiple godowns. For example, you can buy 1000 tons of an item, and split it as 300 tons in Warehouse A, and 700 tons in Warehouse B using the same purchase transaction. This is identical to the way you would allocate Cost Centre details, Order details, and so on.\n\n- Using multiple godowns will treat your inventory in each godown as independent lots.\n\n_When you split your inventory across different godowns, it is assumed that you want to treat them as independent lots and so track and value them accordingly. The Quantity, Rate, and Value that you see in Inventory Reports like Godown Summary or Stock Summary is a sum of these independent lots. If this is not wanted, you should not split the inventory across godowns._\n\n_Let’s consider two scenarios._\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Scenario 1 |\n|  | Transaction 1: 10 Pcs | Transaction 2: 10 pcs | Average | Balance |\n| Warehouse A (21 pcs) | Rs. 15/pc | Rs. 20/pc | Rs. 15/pc | 1 pc valued at Rs. 15 |\n| Warehouse B (11 pcs) | Rs. 30/pc |  |  | 1 pc valued at Rs. 30 |\n\n_As per scenario 1, TallyPrime will show a total of 2 pcs – one at Rs. 15, second at Rs. 30. This makes the average Rs. 22.50 per pc._ _If everything was done in a single warehouse, you would have 3 transactions, as in scenario 2._\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Scenario 2 |\n|  | Transaction 1: 10 Pcs | Transaction 2: 10 pcs | Transaction 3: 10 pcs | Average | Balance |\n| Warehouse A (32 pcs) | Rs. 15/pc | Rs. 20/pc | Rs. 30/pc | Rs. 20/pc | 2 pcs value averaged at Rs. 20/pc |\n\n- TallyPrime by default maintains an internal godown named Main Location.\n\nIf you have been handling inventory without creating any Godown, TallyPrime considers all inventory under Main Location. If you have enabled the Maintain Multiple Godowns option in F11, this internal godown will be visible to you for stock allocation and in the corresponding reports.\n\nWhen you create another godown, all your past entries are initially reflected under Main Location. You can rename this internal godown any time. As in the case of other masters, if you alter anything in the Godown masters, the changes will reflect in the corresponding transactions and reports. And, you can delete a Godown if\n\n- It does not store any stock items.\n- It was not used in any transaction.\n- It is not a parent of other godowns.\n\nTallyPrime summarises details of each location in the Locations/Location Summary report.\n\n## [Use Godowns/Locations for Inventory Storage](https://help.tallysolutions.com/knowledgebase/inventory-storage-using-godowns-locations-tally/\\#Use_Godowns_Locations_for_Inventory_Storage)\n\nIf you are using more than one location, bin, rack, cabinet, and so on, create Godowns/Locations in TallyPrime to track your inventory. Similarly, if you keep inventory in different projects or maintain raw materials and finished goods in separate locations, Godowns/Locations will serve the purpose.\n\nAfter you have created a Godown/Location, you can allocate inventory to the godowns of your choice, including the default godown Main Location.\n\nIn this section\n\n- [Create Godowns/Locations](https://help.tallysolutions.com/inventory-storage-using-godowns-locations-tally/#Create_Godowns_Locations)\n- [Create multiple Godowns/Locations](https://help.tallysolutions.com/inventory-storage-using-godowns-locations-tally/#Create_multiple_Godowns_Locations)\n- [Allocate Stock Items to Godowns/Locations](https://help.tallysolutions.com/inventory-storage-using-godowns-locations-tally/#Allocate_Stock_Items_to_Godowns)\n- [Alter, Delete, and Display Godowns/Locations](https://help.tallysolutions.com/inventory-storage-using-godowns-locations-tally/#Alter__Delete__and_Display_Godowns)\n\n### [Create Godowns/Locations](https://help.tallysolutions.com/knowledgebase/inventory-storage-using-godowns-locations-tally/\\#Create_Godowns_Locations)\n\nTo start allocating your stock items in godowns, you need to create a godown first.\n\n1.

Any unreconciled transactions older than six months are not considered for bank reconciliation.\n\nSolution: [Add the missing opening BRS transactions](https://help.tallysolutions.com/bank-recon-setup/#opening-brs \"https://help.tallysolutions.com/banking-ledgers-deposits-payments-tally/#opening-brs\").\n\n#### **Reason 2: Some Unreconciled Book Transactions/ Vouchers exist prior to the Previous Period**\n\nIn the Bank Reconciliation Summary, in **F12**(Configure), the default option for **Default Period to show unreconciled transactions** is **Previous Financial Period**. If there are any unreconciled transactions before the previous period, then a difference in the balance appears.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nIn the Bank Reconciliation Summary, press **F12** (Configure) and set **Default Period for Unreconciled transactions** as **As per Reconciliation Beginning Date**.\n\nAlternatively, you can [manually](https://help.tallysolutions.com/manual-bank-reconciliation \"https://tally.wiki.tallysolutions.com/wiki/spaces/ProdM/pages/98570119\") reconcile all the unreconciled transactions that were recorded prior to the previous financial period.\n\n#### Reason 3: There are Unreconcil **ed Book Transactions/ Vouchers prior to the Reconciliation Beginning Date**\n\nIf unreconciled transactions exist in the company books before the reconciliation beginning date, a difference appears, as these transactions are not considered while calculating the expected balance.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThere are three ways to solve this:\n\n- Reconcile transactions before the Reconciliation beginning date.\n\n- Update the Opening BRS with unreconciled transactions prior to [Reconciliation Beginning Date](https://help.tallysolutions.com/bank-recon-setup/#recon-beginning-date \"https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/banking-utilities/banking-ledgers-deposits-payments-tally/#recon-beginning-date\").\n\n- Change the [Reconciliation Beginning Date](https://help.tallysolutions.com/bank-recon-setup/#recon-beginning-date \"https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/banking-utilities/banking-ledgers-deposits-payments-tally/#recon-beginning-date\"), so that there are no unreconciled transactions available before the Reconciliation Beginning Date.\n\n#### **Reason 4: A Bank transaction exists in the Company Data and its corresponding Book Transaction /Voucher is Reconciled manually**\n\nConsider that you have reconciled a transaction manually in TallyPrime, as per your previous method of reconciliation.\n\nNow, you have switched to auto-reconciliation. You import a Bank Statement which contains the same reconciled.\n\nHowever, TallyPrime will identify the bank entries as new and unreconciled, thereby showing a difference in balance.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nReconcile the bank entry manually by entering the bank date.\n\nAlternatively, mark the book transaction that you had reconciled manually prior to importing the bank statement as Unreconciled. Thereafter, you can link the book transaction with the bank entry.\n\n#### **Reason 5: Some Book Transactions/ Vouchers or Bank Transactions are missing**\n\nThis happens when a voucher created in the Company is not available in the bank statement OR the bank transaction imported to TallyPrime has not been created in the Company.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n- If there are any bank transactions pending for reconciliation, then create vouchers for those in the Company.\n- If there are any book transactions pending for reconciliation, then wait till the transactions are a part of the bank statement.\n\nAs a result, the transactions get reconciled with no discrepancy.\n\n#### **Reason 6: Vouchers are recorded but not available in Bank Reconciliation Summary**\n\nAt times, vouchers get created but do not become a part of the Bank Reconciliation Summary.\n\nThis might be because the Bank Allocation is not provided in the voucher, especially after the voucher is imported through MS Excel.\n\n**Solution**:\n\n1. Open the voucher, and ensure that Bank Allocation is provided.\n2. Press **Ctrl+A** to save the vouchers.\n\nCheck if the voucher is displayed in the [Bank Reconciliation Summary](https://help.tallysolutions.com/bank-recon-reports/#bank-reconciliation-summary \"https://tally.wiki.tallysolutions.com/wiki/spaces/ProdM/pages/98635614/6.+Bank+Reconciliation+Reports+in+TallyPrime#Bank-Reconciliation-Summary\").\n\n### Related Topics\n\n- [How to Use Bank Reconciliation Reports in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/bank-recon-reports/)\n- [How to Set Up TallyPrime for GST Composition](https://help.tallysolutions.com/setup-tallyprime-for-gst-composition/)\n- [How to Set Up TallyPrime for GST (Regular - SEZ)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/set-up-for-transactions/)\n- [Set Up GST Details in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/gst-setup/)\n- [How to Set Up TallyPrime for e-Payments](https://help.tallysolutions.com/e-payments-set-up/)\n\n[_𝕏_](https://twitter.com/home?status=https://help.tallysolutions.com/bank-recon-setup/) [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://help.tallysolutions.com/bank-recon-setup/ \"facebook\")\n\n![TallyHelpwhatsAppbanner](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Have-another-Query-Desktop-version.jpg)![TallyHelpwhatsAppbanner](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Have-another-Query-Mobile-version.jpg)\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/close-1.png)\n\nIs this information useful?\n\nYesNo\n\nOn this page\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Helpful_icon.png)Helpful?\n\nDidn't find what you are looking for?

      "learning": "Last updated on: September 25, 2025 \\| ⏱ 9 min read\n\nTallyPrime offers a wide range of reconciliation reports catering to your various business needs. To start with, you have a Banking Activities report, where you not only get a bird’s-eye view of transactions available in books and the bank for reconciliation but also get to view your e-payments that are pending to be sent and those that are sent but unreconciled. This gives you a combined view of all banking transactions, and you get to know their status. In turn, this helps you gauge the effort required to reconcile all of them.\n\nOnce you have a consolidated view of your banking transactions, you can get into the Bank Reconciliation Summary that gives you a quick view of the count and amount of unreconciled transactions, and the gap to be filled with the transactions available in books and the bank.\n\nAfter getting a complete overview of pending activities for bank reconciliation, you can further go to the Bank Reconciliation report that gives you the flexibility to do the following:\n\n- Create vouchers for the entries that are in the bank statement but not in the books.\n- Reconcile transactions by linking with their exact matches.\n- View potential matches for the transactions that do not have exact matches.\n- Find matches for the rest of the transactions.\n\nTallyPrime also provides you with a view of the bank entries imported in TallyPrime. With the Imported Bank Data report, you can always view the bank entries with the details of your deposits and withdrawals and the closing balance as per the bank statement. You can also use the report to create vouchers from the bank statement.\n\nYou can also configure the reports to view the values that help you identify transactions better and the action that needs to be taken.\n\nAdditionally, you can set the status manually and even go to the Bank Reconciliation (Manual) report.\n\n## [Banking

      "learning": "Last updated on: February 14, 2025 \\| ⏱ 20 min read\n\nYou will gain end-to-end information on Dashboard in TallyPrime, right from viewing Dashboard, configuring tiles, based on the information you need, setting Dashboard as the home-screen, and the security control you can implement to restrict users from viewing specific tiles in the Dashboard.\n\nDashboard in TallyPrime caters to all your important business information on a single interface, which enables better data analysis and insights. It amalgamates data from more than 350 reports in TallyPrime and acts as a monitoring tool that provides you with a bird’s-eye view of your business health. The default Dashboard in TallyPrime provides you with the tiles that impart an overview of your sales and purchase trends along with trading details, assets & liabilities, cash in and out flow, and others. You also have the flexibility to add or remove tiles from the Dashboard. Furthermore, you can view the Dashboard with tiles placed both horizontally and vertically.\n\nApart from combining data from different TallyPrime reports, Dashboard integrates different pieces of related information that help you understand your business better. For instance, you can view a particular tile with respect to groups, ledgers, cost centres, and other masters, as applicable to the nature of data displayed in the tile.\n\nThe visual representation of trends and comparisons, through bar and line graphs, enables quick and easy analysis of a large volume of data. You have the flexibility to view data, graph, or both in a specific tile. Moreover, you can change the numeral system for the graphs and data to suit your requirement.\n\nYou can configure either the entire Dashboard/all tiles or a specific tile, as needed. Each tile has configuration options applicable to it.\n\nOn the other hand, you can expand a tile if you want to focus on it. You also have the flexibility to configure the Dashboard as a home-screen whenever you load any Company.\n\nHave more questions on Dashboard?

Based on the data represented in the tile and the TallyPrime report from which the data is acquired, you get a set of configurations for each tile. There are some configurations that are common to most of the tiles, and the other configurations are specific to a particular tile, based on the type of data displayed.\n\n### [Configurations common to most of the Tiles](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/dashboard/\\#common-configurations)\n\nThese configurations available in most of the tiles enable you to change the name of the tile, its position in the Dashboard, and display graph, data, or graph & data both, if graph is applicable to the tile.\n\n1. While the cursor is on a specific Tile in the Dashboard, for instance, **Trading Details**, press **Alt+C** (Configure Tile).\n2. **Name of Tile**: You can rename your tile as per your preference, as many number of times as you want.\n3. **Type of Value**: Select from Closing Balance, Nett Transactions, or others, based on the values you want to view in the tile.\n4. **Display type**: Select Data Only, Graph Only, or Data & Graph, based on your requirement.\n\n   - **Graph Type**: When you enable **Graph Only** or **Data & Graph**, you can also select the type of graph you want to view.\n5. **Show Percentages**: If the tile has the facility to view percentages, then you can set this option as **Yes**, if needed.\n6. **Scale Factor**: Like in many reports in TallyPrime, you can select a scale factor, according to the scale on which you want to view the data.\n7. **Sorting Method**: Select **Amount (Decreasing)**, in which the highest amount gets listed at the top followed by the lower ones, or **Amount (Increasing)**, in which the lowest amount gets listed at the top followed by the higher ones.\n\nSimilarly, you can apply Sorting Method based on Quantity.\n8. **Position of Tile**: You can reposition the tile, as needed.\n\nTo know how to do it, refer to the [Position of Tile](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/dashboard/#tile-position) section.\n\n[![Configurations Common to Most Tiles](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/20-tile-configurations-tally.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/20-tile-configurations-tally.gif)\n\n### [Configurations specific to Tiles](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/dashboard/\\#specific-tile-configurations)\n\nTallyPrime ensures that you can configure a particular tile, just like you configure any other report. The intuitive configuration makes your tile all the more useful in terms of information and data analysis.\n\n- While your cursor is on a specific tile, press **Alt+C** (Configure Tile).\n\nThe **Tile Configuration** screen appears.\n\nThere are four groups of tiles in the Dashboard – Accounting, Inventory, Bank/Cash, and Statutory. Let us take an example from each group of tiles to understand the configurations.\n\n#### [Configure Accounting Tiles](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/dashboard/\\#accounting-tile-configurations)\n\nIn the Trading Details tile, which is grouped under Accounting, consider that you want to view the Nett Profit gained for a specific Period. Additionally, you want to view the Direct Expenses and Direct Incomes.\n\nIn such a case, you can configure the tile as per the options in the following image:\n\n[![Configure Trading Details in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/21-trading-details-configuration-tallyprime-1.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/21-trading-details-configuration-tallyprime-1.gif)\n\nOnce you configure the tile, you get to view the desired details as in the image below:\n\n[![Trading Details with Configurations in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/22-trading-details-with-configurations-tallyprime.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/22-trading-details-with-configurations-tallyprime.gif)\n\nSimilarly, you can configure other Accounting tiles, based on the information you want to view.\n\n#### [Configure Inventory Tiles](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/dashboard/\\#inventory-tile-configurations)\n\nIn the Inventory Details tile, which is grouped under Inventory, consider that you want to view the details for a specific Stock Group.\n\nIn such a case, you can configure the tile as per the options in the following image:\n\n[![Configure Inventory Details](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/23-configuring-inventory-details-tile-tally.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/23-configuring-inventory-details-tile-tally.gif)\n\nOnce you configure the tile, you get to view the desired details as in the image below:\n\n[![Inventory Tile Configured in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/24-inventory-tile-configured-tallyprime.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/24-inventory-tile-configured-tallyprime.gif)\n\nSimilarly, you can configure other Inventory tiles, based on the information you want to view.\n\n#### [Configure Bank/Cash Tiles](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/dashboard/\\#back-cash-tiles-configuration)\n\nIn the Cash In/Out Flow tile, which is grouped under Bank/Cash, consider that you want to view the Nett Flow, Inflow, and Outflow for Sundry Debtors.\n\nIn such a case, you can configure the tile as per the options in the following image:\n\n[![Configure Cash In or Out Flow](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/25-cash-in-out-flow-configurations-tally.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/25-cash-in-out-flow-configurations-tally.gif)\n\nOnce you configure the tile, you get to view the desired details as in the image below:\n\n[![Cash In/Out Tile Configured in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/26-cash-in-out-configured-tallyprime.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/26-cash-in-out-configured-tallyprime.gif)\n\nSimilarly, you can configure other Bank/Cash tiles, based on the information you want to view.\n\n#### [Configure Statutory Tiles](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/dashboard/\\#statutory-tiles-configuration)\n\nConsider that you want to view the pending actions that you need to take to reconcile GSTR-2A. So, you will not want to view the reconciled transactions in the tile.\n\nIn such a case, you can configure the tile as per the options in the following image:\n\n[![Configure GSTR-2A Reconciliation in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/27-gstr-2a-reconciliation-tallyprime.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/27-gstr-2a-reconciliation-tallyprime.gif)\n\nOnce you configure the tile, you can see that the Reconciled Transactions are not part of the tile:\n\n[![GSTR-2A Reconciliation Tile Configured in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/28-gstr-2a-reconciliation-tile-configured-tallyprime.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/28-gstr-2a-reconciliation-tile-configured-tallyprime.gif)\n\nSimilarly, you can configure other Statutory tiles, based on the information you want to view.\n\n## [Save View of Dashboard](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/dashboard/\\#save-view)\n\nDashboard comes with a set of [Predefined Views](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/dashboard/#predefined-views) saved for your immediate reference. If you want to refer to the tiles relevant to Sales, then you can open the Sales Dashboard. Similarly, if you want to refer to the tiles relevant to Purchase, then you can open the Purchase Dashboard. You can also modify the Predefined Views and then save the view with a different name for future reference.\n\nSimilar to any other report in TallyPrime, you can save a view for Dashboard with the kind of values you want to view in the tiles. You can configure the tiles, based on the required information, and retain the configurations by saving the view. By doing so, you will not need to configure the tiles every now and then. You can just open the saved view of the Dashboard and view the details, according to the way tiles are configured.\n\nYou can also save the view for a specific period. For instance, you can change the Period of the Dashboard or specific tiles and then save the view, so that you can refer to it in the future.\n\nWhat’s more, if you want to view the Dashboard with specific tiles and configurations, you can save it on your computer for all Companies. As a result, the Dashboard will be accessible to all the Companies on the computer.\n\nIn a multi-user environment, if you save the view in a specific Company, then all the users will be able to view the Dashboard whenever they are working on the Company.\n\nTo know how to save a view, refer to the [Save View for Reports in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/how-to-save-views-of-reports-in-tallyprime/) topic.\n\nYou can also refer to our video [Save Views, Set / Alter Default Views & Delete Views for Reports in TallyPrime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmeUSJTRtMw).\n\n## [Print, Export, E-mail, or WhatsApp a Single Tile or All Tiles](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/dashboard/\\#print-export-email-tile)\n\nYou can print and export the Dashboard and specific tiles, as needed. Moreover, through e-mail or WhatsApp, you can share the Dashboard or specific tiles with your colleague, chartered accountant, or top management for reference, as needed.\n\nAll you need to do is configure all the tiles or specific tiles as per the type of values you want to view. Thereafter, you can print, export, e-mail, or WhatsApp, as needed.\n\n### [Print a Single Tile or All Tiles](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/dashboard/\\#print-tile-dashboard)\n\nBased on the cursor position on a specific tile, you can configure before printing the tile.\n\n[![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/watch-video.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qZgm3usTkc)\n\n1.

By doing so, instead of Gateway of Tally, you get to see the important data the moment you load the Company.\n\nYou also have the flexibility to revert the configuration and see Gateway of Tally whenever you load a Company.\n\nThis is a one-time configuration for the TallyPrime application. Once you configure your application, the default Dashboard will be set as the home-screen for all the Companies that you will ever load in the application.\n\n1. Press **F1** (Help) > **Settings** \\> **Startup** and press **Enter**.\n2. **Open Dashboard on loading a Company**: **Yes**.\n\n[![Open Dashboard on Loading a Company in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/33-open-dashboard-on-loading-a-company-tallyprime.gif)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/33-open-dashboard-on-loading-a-company-tallyprime.gif)\n\nHenceforth, whenever you load a Company in this TallyPrime application, the home-screen will be the Dashboard.\n\n## [Access Dashboard Based on User Roles \\| Security Controls](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/dashboard/\\#access-control)\n\nIn your business, you may be having a range of employees engaged in a variety of work on TallyPrime. An accountant may require Balance Sheet on a daily basis, while a data entry operator might be allowed to only create masters or transactions. In such scenarios, you may want to hide the Dashboard or certain tiles of the Dashboard from a user, based on their user role in the organisation. You can easily add security controls for Dashboard and tiles in the Dashboard, as needed.\n\nBy default, the Dashboard and all the tiles are allowed to be viewed when you load a Company using the Username and Password of the users created under the Tally.NET Owner, Owner/Administrator, or Tally.NET Auditor security level. You can view Dashboard only if the owner or admin has allowed you to view it under security levels.\n\nMoreover, if TallyPrime is set to open the Dashboard at the time of loading a Company, and you do not have access to the Dashboard, you get a message and then you can continue towards Gateway of Tally.\n\nMoreover, as a Data Entry user, you might be having access to the inventory report. However, you may not be able to view the inventory tiles in the Dashboard until the owner or administrator allows you to view the Dashboard and/or the specific tiles in the Dashboard.\n\nConsider that you want to allow Data Entry users to view the Dashboard. However, you want to disallow them from accessing the Assets/Liabilities tile, as it contains the financial information of your business.\n\nYou can do so through User Roles under Company in TallyPrime.\n\n1. Press **Alt+K** (Company) > **User Roles** and press **Enter**.\n2. Select the role under the **List of Security Levels**.\n\nFor instance, select **Data Entry**.\n\nThe **Security Levels** screen appears.\n3.

      "title": "Working with Reports in TallyPrime",
      "learning": "Last updated on: May 19, 2025 \\| ⏱ 19 min read\n\nIn any business, reports play an important role in giving a view of the business performance. Using reports you can see your daily sales or purchases, profit margins, stock position and so on. Reports help you view details of your day-to-day transactions and are useful for reporting, auditing and filing purposes. In TallyPrime, you can access all such reports and view real-time data based on your transactions, as and when you need. Moreover, with a report like [Dashboard](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/dashboard) that provides advanced data analysis with a visual interpretation in graphs, you can take data-driven decisions by referring to various tiles that cater to your many business requirements.\n\nWorking with reports in TallyPrime provides several flexibilities and ease of data analysis.\n\n**Find your reports easily**: In TallyPrime, reports are organised in such a way that you can access them quickly with minimal effort. Drill down through the **Gateway of Tally** screen and look for the group that your report belongs to. You can also search and open a particular report at any given point by using **Go To** feature in TallyPrime.\n\n**Navigate in reports with shortcuts**: To provide an easy report viewing experience, TallyPrime supports several keyboard shortcuts that you can use to navigate and perform various frequent tasks. You can drill down on any line by simply pressing **Enter** or see the details of a transaction by pressing **Alt+F5**. Whether you need to select a single line or multiple lines, remove/restore lines, or delete a transaction in a report, TallyPrime supports standard, easy-to-use keyboard shortcuts to perform all such tasks.\n\n- **Bottom bar**: If you are on TallyPrime Release 2.0.1, you can view keyboard shortcuts and related actions on the bottom bar corresponding to each screen. This will enable you to quickly refer to the shortcut to be used for a specific action, without interrupting the flow of your work.\n\n**Configure your reports \\| Right buttons**: Every report in TallyPrime is supported with a set of buttons on the right panel that are commonly used to view additional report details, set the context for the report, and sort the report details based on selected parameters.\n\nFor example, you can view your reports for a specific date or period. you can view amounts in base currency, or display the values in a report with a selected factor of number (crores, hundredths, and so on). Similarly, you can include or exclude specific information, such as profit margin, post-dated transactions, and so on, for better analysis of the data.\n\n**Export, E-mail, WhatsApp and print reports on the fly**: In your business, you not only view your business reports, but may also need to share them with others for various reasons like auditing, MIS reporting, or filing your returns. Using TallyPrime, you can export, e-mail, WhatsApp and print your reports as needed.\n\nFor example, you can print reports like Reminder Letters and Confirmation of Accounts and share with your parties or keep with you for reference. Similarly, you can e-mail your financial report or voucher reports with your CA for verification and reconciliation.\n\nIn addition, TallyPrime supports several application-level, one-time configurations for using these features. This helps you save time and effort from configuring each report separately, unless you need to configure them only for that instance.\n\n## Navigate to Reports \\| Gateway of Tally & Go To vs Switch To\n\nIn TallyPrime, reports are categorised under specific groups so that you can find the required reports easily. You can open a report through **Gateway of Tally** or by using the **Go To** feature. **Gateway of Tally** helps you progressively navigate to the reports as you drill down. **Go To** lists all the reports by default in different groups under a common selection table. Using **Go To**, you can simply type a report name and search the report, without having to move out of the screen you have already opened.\n\n1. Press **Alt+G** (Go To) > type of select a report and press **Enter**.\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/go-to-reports-2-2.jpg)\n\nAlternatively, **Gateway of Tally** \\> **Display More Reports** \\> drill down to different groups and select the required report.\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gateway-of-tally-1-1.jpg)\n2. You can also press **Expand All** to see all the reports upfront under each group. Reports that are less frequently used are generally not shown by default. Press **Show More** to list all the reports under **Go To**.\n\nFor more details on using **Go To**, refer to [Get Familiar with TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/welcome-to-tally-prime/tallyprime-features/).\n\n## View Report Details\n\nIn your business, when you record all your transactions, you will certainly want to view different reports to track the transactions and analyse your business performance. Reports in TallyPrime, by default display your company name, report name, period for which the report is open, and column and rows with specific inputs from your transactions.\n\nFor example, to analyse the financial health of your company, you can refer to the financial reports like Balance Sheet, Profit & Loss Statement, and so on. Similarly, the outstanding reports display details of your funds receivables and payables; the cash flow and funds flow reports display the fund projections for your business; and so on.\n\nAs you navigate within TallyPrime, all your reports are logically classified based on the report types. Reports like Balance Sheet and P&L Statement are grouped under Final Accounts; Bank Reconciliation and e-Payments are grouped under Banking Utilities; and so on.\n\nWhat’s more! You can quickly drill down on each line in a report to explode and view specific details, as part of the same report or in a separate report.\n\n**1. Explode/collapse details of a single line entry in the same report:** Select a line > press **Shift+Enter** on the selected line.\n\nYou can expand or collapse each line entry in a report to view specific details.\n\n_**Example:**_\n\n- In **Day Book**, press **Shift+Enter** to view details of a transaction, such as the participating ledgers. A sample image of the Day Book appears, as shown below:\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/day-book-shift-enter.jpg)\n- Similarly, in the **Godown Summary** report, press **Shift+Enter** on the selected godown to see the next level of data for that godown on the same screen. You can move to any of the lines in the next level and further explode the selected line using **Shift+Enter**.\n\n  - If you press **Shift+Enter** on **Main Location** till the last level, you can view the stock items, as shown below:\n\n    ![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/godown-summary-shift-enter.jpg)\n\n**2\\. Expand/collapse details of all line entries in the same report:** Press **Alt+F1** or **Alt+F5**.\n\nIn TallyPrime, you can view the next level of details for all line entries in a report in a single go.\n\nExample: In **Day Book**, press **Alt+F5** (Detailed) to view the next level of data for all the godowns appearing in the report.\n\n**![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/day-book-detailed-view.jpg)**\n\n**3\\. View next level details in a separate report:** Select a line > press **Enter.**\n\nIf you need to view the next level details of a line entry for a report in a different screen, you can do so by pressing Enter on the selected line.\n\nExample: In **Godown Summary**, press **Enter** on the selected godown – say Main Location – to view the next level of data in a new screen. For example, if you press Enter on Main Location, the godown Koramangala Godown with other godowns and any additional stock groups will be shown in a new screen.\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/godown-summary-main-location.jpg)\n\nUpon drilling down to the last level of data (that is the stock item in this case), you can press **Enter** to open the monthly summary report, as in the case of other summary reports.\n\n## [Stripe View](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/reports-in-tallyprime/working-with-reports/\\#stripe-view-in-reports)\n\nUsing stripes in TallyPrime Release 5.0, you can view data in each row of any report distinctly. The Stripe View feature enhances the overall readability of data, and can also be used for Print, Export, E-mail, and WhatsApp.\n\nWhether you have data in condensed or detailed mode, or in multiple columns, Stripe View is designed to support all such situations.\n\nFor more information, refer to the [Enable Stripe View](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/welcome-to-tally-prime/tallyprime-features/#enable-stripe-view) section in the [Get Familiar with TallyPrime and TallyPrime Edit Log Features](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/welcome-to-tally-prime/tallyprime-features/#get-familiar-with-tallyprime-and-tallyprime-edit-log-features) topic.\n\nOnce you have enabled Stripe View, you can view Day Book, as shown below:\n\n[![Day Book ](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/db.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/db.png)\n\nWhen switched to detailed mode, you can view Day Book, as shown below:\n\n[![Day Book Detailed](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/db-e.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/db-e.png)\n\nThe Stripe View feature works perfectly fine for reports where data is represented across multiple sections and each section remains independent of the other, such as Ratio Analysis report and Balance Sheet.\n\nOnce you have enabled Stripe View for Ratio Analysis, you can view the report, as shown below:\n\n[![Ratio Analysis](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ratio.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ratio.png)\n\nOnce you have enabled Stripe View for Profit and Loss account, you can view the report, as shown below:\n\n[![P&L Report](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pl.png)](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pl.png)\n\n## [Keyboard Shortcuts – Select Lines \\| Remove & Restore Lines \\| Add, Insert, Duplicate Vouchers](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/welcome-to-tally-prime/working-with-reports/\\#shortcuts-bottom-bar)\n\nTo make your reports more handy, TallyPrime supports several keyboard shortcuts that can be used for quick actions within the reports. For example, when you are on Day Book, you may want to quickly add or insert a voucher, create a duplicate voucher entry, or even alter an existing voucher. Similarly, when you are viewing the Stock Summary or Godown Summary, you may want to remove a line showing negative value, and restore it back later. Using keyboard shortcut eliminates the need for moving away from the reports to perform an activity and optimises your time.\n\n### [Bottom bar](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/welcome-to-tally-prime/working-with-reports/\\#bottom-bar)\n\nStarting Release 2.0.1, you will find all such keyboard shortcuts along with their corresponding actions on the **bottom bar** of every screen.\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/day-book-with-bottom-bar.jpg)\n\nIn case you want to hide the bottom bar from the screens:\n\n- Press **F1** (Help) > **Settings** \\> **Display** \\> **Application** \\> set **Show bottom bar** to **No**.\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bottom-bar-hide-configuration.jpg)\n\nThe following are a few examples of the actions that you perform using the keyboard shortcuts available on the bottom bar.\n\n**Select one or more lines**\n\nOn any report\n\n1. To select a single line, press **Spacebar**.\n2. To select the next line (more than one line), press the down arrow > **Spacebar**.\n3. To select all the lines, press **Ctrl+Spacebar**.\n\nOnce the lines are selected, you can use the same keyboard shortcut to deselect the lines.\n\n**Remove and restore lines**\n\nIn some reports, you may want to hide some of the lines to understand the details better. For example, you want to view Day Books with all lines except the Order vouchers. You can remove the line temporarily and restore it back in the report.\n\n- **Day Book** \\> select one or more lines by pressing **Spacebar** \\> press **Ctrl+R** (Remove Line).\n\nIf you have removed multiple lines, and would want to restore all of them together, press **Alt+U** (Restore All).\n\nSimilarly, you can perform other actions, such as deleting vouchers ( **Alt+D**), cancelling vouchers ( **Alt+X**), or even quit ( **Ctrl+Q**) the report – all of which are available on the bottom bar.\n\n## Right Buttons – Set Context \\| Sort & Filter Data \\| View Additional Details \\| Save View\n\nWhile viewing any report, you will certainly want to further analyse the report details depending on your business requirements. For example, you may need to see the Balance Sheet based on a specific valuation method. Similarly, you will may want to see the profit made on all sales using the Day Book. You can also switch the context of any report from one company to another to perform specific actions. All such activities can be quickly done in reports using the right buttons.\n\n### Set Context for Reports\n\nIn TallyPrime, the top three buttons on the right button bar are used to set the context for your reports.\n\n**![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/day-book-top-right-buttons.jpg)**\n\n- **F2: Date** or **F2: Period** – Change the date or period of the report to view details specific to the specified period.\n- **F3: Company** – Use this button to change the company instantly, without you having to close the current company.\n- **F4** – This button name differs based on the report you are viewing. However, the common use of this button is to set the context for the report to view related details. For example, in Day Book, you can set the context to view the details specific to Sales. Similarly, if you are viewing the Stock Summary, you can select a specific Stock Group to view the summary.\n\n### Sort & Filter and View Additional Report Details\n\nThe right buttons in reports enable you to further analyse the report data by sorting, filtering or viewing additional details specific to each report. Whether you want to view the profit-related details in Stock Summary or view ledger-wise Trial Balance, all of these are possible using the right buttons.\n\n- **Stock Summary > F5: Stock Item-wise** – Displays the report with the summary of all stock items.\n- **Stock Summary > F6: Monthly** – Displays the monthly summary for the stock groups.\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/stock-summary-right-buttons.jpg)\n\n- Similarly, **Bills Payables > F6: Bills Receivables** – Displays the details of all bills for which you are yet to receive the payments from your parties.\n\nIn reports, **Alt+F5** in the right button bar can be used to view next set of details for a line, similar to using **Alt+F1**.\n\nYou can explore all such activities in different reports using the right buttons, based on your specific business needs.\n\nAdditionally, you can also use the following right buttons to configure the values and other details of your report, open specific views and related reports, or view exceptions.\n\n- Basis of Values\n- Change View\n- Exception Reports\n\nRefer to the following sections for more details.\n\n## Ctrl+B: Basis of Values \\| Value-Based Configurations\n\nYou can configure the values in your report for that instance, based on different business needs.\n\n**Example:**\n\nIn Day Book, you can display the values based on the **Type of Voucher Entries** you select.\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/day-book-basis-of-values.jpg)\n\n- Press **Ctrl** + **B**(Basis of Values) > **Type of Voucher Entries** \\> select **Accounting Entries Only**.\n- Press **Esc** to view the default values.\n\nSimilarly, you can view the total values related to **Forex Transactions** only. Press **Ctrl** + **B**(Basis of Values) > **Show Forex Transactions only** \\> and press **Enter**.\n\n## Ctrl+H: Change View & Related Reports\n\nYou can display the details of a report in different views with additional details or for a specific period. You can also view other reports related to the current report.\n\n**Example:**\n\nIn Stock Summary, you can change the details from Stock Group-wise view to Stock Item-wise view. You can also open related report for the same context of the Stock Summary.\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/stock-summary-change-view.jpg)\n\n- Press **Ctrl** + **H**(Change View) > type or select **Monthly Summary** or **Ageing Analysis** \\> and press **Enter**.\n- Press **Esc** to view the default report.\n\n## Ctrl+J: Exception Reports\n\nFor certain reports, you may want to view the exceptions to better assess the performance of your business. For example, you may have negative ledgers that have an impact on your overall cash or funds flow. Similarly, you may have created certain optional vouchers or post-dated vouchers while recording your day-to-day transactions. You will certainly want to see such vouchers separately as on a specific date. All such details are available as Exception Reports on the right button bar.\n\n**Example:**\n\nIn Day Book\n\n- Press **Ctrl+J** (Exception Report) > select the required report from **List of Exception Report** \\> press **Enter**.\n\n## Ctrl+L: Save View \\| Save Your Reports\n\nWhen you view your reports, you would generally configure them based on specific business needs. At the same time, you may need to refer to the same report in regular intervals. If you are using TallyPrime Release 2.0 or later, you can save view of your reports in just a couple of steps. You can not only access the saved views of your reports, you can allow other users too to view and update as you need.\n\n**Example:**\n\n1. Open Balance Sheet and configure as your need.\n2. Press **Ctrl+L** (Save View) and provide an appropriate name to the report.\n\nYour report will start appearing in the list displayed under **Go To**.\n\nNote that anytime you open the saved view of the report, you will be able to view real-time data for the period of the report you had saved.\n\nFor more details, refer to the [Save View in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/accounting-financial-reports/how-to-save-views-of-reports-in-tallyprime/) topic.\n\n## [Compare Report Details \\| New Column, Alter Column, Delete Column, Auto-Column](https://help.tallysolutions.com/working-with-reports/\\#compare-report-details)\n\nTallyPrime enables you to compare details in a report by displaying details in a new column as per your selected parameters. For example, you can compare stock summary for two different quarters or alter the parameters in the column when needed. You can also display data in repeated columns for based on a selected periodicity. Once you have compared the details as per your requirement, you can delete unnecessary columns.\n\n**Example:**\n\nIn Stock Summary\n\n- Press **Alt+C** (New Column) > set the required parameters > press **Enter**.\n\nThe report displays an additional column for comparison based on the parameters that you have set.\n\n## F12: Configure Reports\n\nEach report is supported by a set of configurations that you may require while viewing the details of the report. You can enable or disable the configurations depending on your business-specific requirements.\n\n**Example:**\n\nIn Balance Sheet\n\n- Press **F12** (Configure) > **Show Vertical Balance Sheet: Yes**.\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/balance-sheet-f12.jpg)\n\nSimilarly, you can configure your reports, as needed.\n\n## Share Reports \\| Export, E-mail, WhatsApp & Print\n\nSharing financial and other business reports with clients and peers is common. Using the Export, E-mail, WhatsApp and Print features in TallyPrime, you can share your reports anytime you need. TallyPrime supports certain one-time configurations for Export, E-mail, WhatsApp and Print. These are application-level (global) configurations that will be applied to all your reports anytime you use them. At the same time, TallyPrime provides the flexibility of overriding the global configurations and configuring each report individually using F12 (Configure) and other right buttons. This flexibility helps you do a common setup for your reports for regular use and customise each report as and when needed based on your preferences.\n\n_In this section:_\n\n- [Export](https://help.tallysolutions.com/working-with-reports/#export)\n- E-mail\n- Print\n\n### [Export](https://help.tallysolutions.com/working-with-reports/\\#export)\n\nIf you regularly export reports for any specific purpose, you can configure the Export process that suits your requirements. For example, you can set the location of the files, or choose to open the file each time it gets exported. While these configurations are set for all reports, you can override these configurations for each report. Refer to the [Exporting Data](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime-server/data-management-tallyprime-server/export-data-in-tallyprime-server/) topic for more information.\n\n### [E-mail](https://help.tallysolutions.com/working-with-reports/\\#e-mail)\n\nTo share reports via E-mail or send reminder letters to your parties to collect outstanding amounts on time, you can use the E-mail feature in TallyPrime. Similar to Export, you can configure the E-mail feature, such as set up pre-defined e-mail profiles and messages, select the company details that you want to include in the report headers, and the recipient list and so on. Refer to the [E-mailing](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/data-management/e-mailing-in-tallyprime/) topic for more information.\n\n### WhatsApp\n\nIn TallyPrime you can now send your invoices and reports directly to your party’s WhatsApp number. Within just a few seconds, you can share your reports, invoices, and other significant business documents from TallyPrime to your customers’ WhatsApp. To get started with it, you just need to have a business WhatsApp no. registered with Meta and your party’s WhatsApp no. Just a few simple steps and you can share vouchers, orders, invoices with payment links, reports, and more, in no time. To know more, refer to How to Send Documents from TallyPrime Using WhatsApp.\n\n### [Print](https://help.tallysolutions.com/working-with-reports/\\#print)\n\nPrinting reports in TallyPrime is simple. Similar to other features like Export and E-mail, the Print feature helps you to configure the process and also decide the information you want to print on the reports every time. For example, if you need to use a specific printer every time you print or want the company logo to be included in the document, you can set such configurations across all reports (and vouchers). However, based on your preference for certain reports (one or more reports), you can change the print configuration for that specific report to override the common configurations.\n\nUnlike in earlier releases of TallyPrime, in Release 1.1.4, you can set Preview as the default for all the reports to avoid the possibility of printing by pressing the Enter key by mistake.\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/print-preview-default.jpg)\n\nIn addition, TallyPrime Release 1.1.4 onwards, you can perform all the immediate print-related activities straight from the right button bar. Activities like changing printer, setting up format or paper type for printing, or updating the title/sub-title of the report will not require you to open the **F12** Configuration list anymore.\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/print-options-right-buttons.jpg)\n\nFor more information on Print, refer to [Printing in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-prime/welcome-to-tally-prime/how-to-print-invoices-and-reports-in-tallyprime/).\n\n## Common Shortcut Keys in Reports\n\nClick the following links for some of the frequently used shortcut keys and their use in reports.\n\nRight Buttons\n\n- F2 – To change date or period for the report.\n- F3 – To change company, select company or shut company.\n- F4 – To change the context of the report.\n- Ctrl+B – To configure values in the report.\n- Ctrl+H – To change the view of the report without changing the context of period, ledger or another other configuration that you make.\n- Ctrl+J – To view list of exception reports related to the report that you have opened.\n- Alt+N – To add a new column with specific parameters for comparing the details in the report.\n- Alt+A – To alter the parameters in the newly added column.\n- Alt+D – To delete any columns that you have added for comparison of report details.\n- Alt+O – To display reports details by repeating columns based on the selected periodicity.\n- F12 – To configure report details.\n- Ctrl+Q – To quit the report.\n- Enter – To drill-down on a selected line in a report.\n\nYou can explore other right button options in reports.Bottom Bar\n\n- Space – To select a line\n- Ctrl+Space – To select all lines\n- Alt+A – To add a voucher in Day Book\n- Alt+2 – To duplicate a voucher in Day Book\n- Alt+D – To delete a voucher entry\n- Alt+X – to Cancel a voucher in Day Book\n- Ctrl+R – To remove a line\n- Ctrl+U – To restore the line\n\n### Related Topics\n\n- [How to Use Bank Reconciliation Reports in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/bank-recon-reports/)\n- [How to View VAT Reports in TallyPrime](https://help.tallysolutions.com/india-vat-reports-in-tallyprime/)\n- [How to View TallyPrime Reports in Browser](https://help.tallysolutions.com/tally-reports-in-browser-tally/)\n- [Synchronisation Reports in TallyPrime \\| TallyHelp](https://help.tallysolutions.com/synchronisation-reports/)\n- [How to Apply Filter in Reports in TallyPrime \\| Basic Filter, Multi-Filter, Advanced Filter](https://help.tallysolutions.com/apply-filter-in-reports/)\n\n[_𝕏_](https://twitter.com/home?status=https://help.tallysolutions.com/working-with-reports/) [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://help.tallysolutions.com/working-with-reports/ \"facebook\")\n\n![TallyHelpwhatsAppbanner](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Have-another-Query-Desktop-version.jpg)![TallyHelpwhatsAppbanner](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Have-another-Query-Mobile-version.jpg)\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/close-1.png)\n\nIs this information useful?\n\nYesNo\n\nOn this page\n\n![](https://help.tallysolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Helpful_icon.png)Helpful?\n\nDidn't find what you are looking for?

All you need is TallyPrime, and a device with a web browser and internet connection.\n\n**Anywhere, Any device**: You can access TallyPrime reports in browser from anywhere using any device such as, laptop, smartphone, tablet, and so on, with a web browser, and an active internet connection.\n\n**Security and Control**: You have complete control on who views the reports, and which reports are available to a user. Further, your data will always be in your machine.
